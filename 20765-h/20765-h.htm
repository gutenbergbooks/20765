<p class = "break">
IN the year 1770, a bright little girl ten years of age, Anna Green
Winslow, was sent from her far away home in Nova Scotia to Boston, the
birthplace of her parents, to be "finished" at Boston schools by Boston
teachers. She wrote, with evident eagerness and loving care, for the
edification of her parents and her own practice in penmanship, this
interesting and quaint diary, which forms a most sprightly record, not
only of the life of a young girl at that time, but of the prim and
narrow round of daily occurrences in provincial Boston. It thus assumes
a positive value as an historical picture of the domestic life of that
day; a&nbsp;value of which the little girl who wrote it, or her kinsfolk
who affectionately preserved it to our own day, never could have
dreamed. To many New England families it is specially interesting as a
complete rendering, a&nbsp;perfect presentment, of the childish life of
their great grandmothers, her companions.</p>

<p>It is an even chance which ruling thought
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<a name = "pageiv" id = "pageiv"> </a>
in the clever little writer, a&nbsp;love of religion or a love of dress,
shows most plainly its influence on this diary. On the whole,
I&nbsp;think that youthful vanity, albeit of a very natural and innocent
sort, is more pervasive of the pages. And it is fortunate that this is
the case; for, from the frankly frivolous though far from self-conscious
entries we gain a very exact notion, a&nbsp;very valuable picture, of
the dress of a young girl at that day. We know all the details of her
toilet, from the "pompedore" shoes and the shifts (which she had never
worn till she lived in Boston), to the absurd and top-heavy
head-decoration of "black feathers, my past comb &amp; all my past
garnet marquasett and jet pins, together with my silver plume." If this
fantastic assemblage of ornament were set upon the "Heddus roll," so
graphically described, it is easy to understand the denunciations of the
time upon women's headgear. In no contemporary record or account, no
matter who the writer, can be found such a vivacious and witty
description of the modish hairdressing of that day as in the pages of
this diary.</p>

<p>But there are many entries in the journal of this vain little Puritan
devotee to show an almost equal attention to religion; records of
sermons which she had heard, and of religious
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
<a name = "pagev" id = "pagev"> </a>
conversations in which she had taken a self-possessed part; and her
frequent use of Biblical expressions and comparisons shows that she also
remembered fully what she read. Her ambitious theological sermon-notes
were evidently somewhat curtailed by the sensible advice of the aunt
with whom she resided, who thereby checked also the consequent
injudicious praise of her pastor, the Old South minister. For Anna and
her kinsfolk were of the congregation of the Old South church; and this
diary is in effect a record of the life of Old South church attendants.
Many were what Anna terms "sisters of the Old South," and nine tenths of
the names of her companions and friends may be found on the baptismal
and membership records of that church.</p>

<p>Anna was an industrious little wight, active in all housewifely
labors and domestic accomplishments, and attentive to her lessons. She
could make "pyes," and fine network; she could knit lace, and spin linen
thread and woolen yarn; she could make purses, and embroider
pocket-books, and weave watch strings, and piece patchwork. She learned
"dansing, or danceing I should say," from one Master Turner; she
attended a sewing school, to become a neat and deft little sempstress,
and above all, she attended a writing school to
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
<a name = "pagevi" id = "pagevi"> </a>
learn that most indispensable and most appreciated of eighteenth century
accomplishments&mdash;fine writing. Her handwriting, of which a
fac-simile is here shown, was far better than that of most girls of
twelve to-day; with truth and justice could Anna say, "Aunt says I can
write pretily." Her orthography was quite equal to that of grown persons
of her time, and her English as good as that of Mercy Warren, her older
contemporary writer.</p>

<p>And let me speak also of the condition of her diary. It covers
seventy-two pages of paper about eight inches long by six and a half
inches wide. The writing is uniform in size, every letter is perfectly
formed; it is as legible as print, and in the entire diary but three
blots can be seen, and these are very small. A&nbsp;few pages were ruled
by the writer, the others are unruled. The old paper, though heavy and
good, is yellow with age, and the water marks C.F.R. and the crown stand
out distinctly. The sheets are sewed in a little book, on which a
marbled paper cover has been placed, probably by a later hand than
Anna's. Altogether it is a remarkably creditable production for a girl
of twelve.</p>

<p>It is well also to compare her constant diligence and industry
displayed to us through her records of a day's work&mdash;and at another
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<a name = "pagevii" id = "pagevii"> </a>
time, of a week's work&mdash;with that of any girl of her age in a
corresponding station of life nowadays. We learn that physical pain or
disability were no excuse for slothfulness; Anna was not always
well&mdash;had heavy colds, and was feverish; but well or ill was always
employed. Even with painful local afflictions such as a "whitloe," she
still was industrious, "improving it to perfect myself in learning to
spin flax." She read much&mdash;the Bible constantly&mdash;and also
found amusement in reading "a variety of composures."</p>

<p>She was a friendly little soul, eager to be loved; resenting deeply
that her Aunt Storer let "either one of her chaises, her chariot or
babyhutt," pass the door every day, without sending for her; going
cheerfully tea-drinking from house to house of her friends; delighting
even in the catechising and the sober Thursday Lecture. She had few
amusements and holidays compared with the manifold pleasures that
children have nowadays, though she had one holiday which the Revolution
struck from our calendar&mdash;the King's Coronation Day. She saw the
Artillery Company drill, and she visited brides and babies and old
folks, and attended some funerals. When she was twelve years old she
"came out"&mdash;became a "miss in her teens"&mdash;and went to a
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<a name = "pageviii" id = "pageviii"> </a>
succession of prim little routs or parties, which she called
"constitutions." To these decorous assemblies girls only were
invited,&mdash;no rough Boston boys. She has left to us more than one
clear, perfect picture of these formal little routs in the great
low-raftered chamber, softly alight with candles on mantel-tree and in
sconces; with Lucinda, the black maid, "shrilly piping;" and rows of
demure little girls of Boston Brahmin blood, in high rolls and feathers,
discreetly partaking of hot and cold punch, and soberly walking and
curtsying through the minuet; fantastic in costume, but proper and
seemly in demeanor, models of correct deportment as were their elegant
mammas.</p>

<p>But Anna was not solemn; she was always happy, and often
merry&mdash;full of life and wit. She jested about getting a "fresh
seasoning with Globe salt," and wrote some labored jokes and some
unconscious ones home to her mother. She was subject to "egregious fits
of laughterre," and fully proved the statement, "Aunt says I am a
whimsical child." She was not beautiful. Her miniature is now owned by
Miss Elizabeth C. Trott of Niagara Falls, the great grand-daughter of
General John Winslow, and a copy is shown in the frontispiece. It
displays a gentle, winning
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<a name = "pageix" id = "pageix"> </a>
little face, delicate in outline, as is also the figure, and showing
some hint also of delicacy of constitution. It may be imagination to
think that it is plainly the face of one who could never live to be
old&mdash;a&nbsp;face typical of youth.</p>


<p class = "break">
LET us glance at the stock from whence sprung this tender and engaging
little blossom. When the weary Pilgrims landed at Cape Cod before they
made their memorable landing at Plymouth, a&nbsp;sprightly young girl
jumped on shore, and was the first English woman to set foot on the soil
of New England. Her name was Mary Chilton. She married John Winslow, the
brother of Governor Edward Winslow. Anna Green Winslow was Mary
Chilton's direct descendant in the sixth generation.</p>

<p>Anna's grandfather, John Winslow the fourth, was born in Boston. His
son Joshua wrote thus in the Winslow Family Bible: "Jno Winslow my
Honor'd Father was born ye 31 Dec. at 6 o'c. in the morning on the Lords
Day, 1693, and was baptized by Mr. Willard the next day &amp; dyed att
sea Octo. 13, 1731 aged 38 years." A&nbsp;curious attitude was assumed
by certain Puritan ministers, of
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
<a name = "pagex" id = "pagex"> </a>
reluctance and even decided objection and refusal to baptize children
who were unlucky enough to be born on the Lord's Day; but Samuel
Willard, the pastor of the "South Church" evidently did not concur in
that extraordinary notion, for on the day following "Jno's"
birth&mdash;on New Year's Day&mdash;he was baptized. He was married on
September 21, 1721, to Sarah Pierce, and in their ten years of married
life they had three children.</p>

<p>Joshua Winslow, Anna's father, was the second child. He was born
January 23, 1727, and was baptized at the Old South. He was "published"
with his cousin Anna Green on December 7, 1758, and married to her four
weeks later, January 3, 1759. An old piece of embroidered tapestry
herein shown gives a good portrayal of a Boston wedding-party at that
date; the costumes, coach, and cut of the horses' mane and tail are very
curious and interesting to note. Mrs. Winslow's mother was Anna Pierce
(sister of Sarah), and her father was Joseph Green, the fourth
generation from Percival Green, whose descendants have been enumerated
by Dr. Samuel Abbott Green, the president of the Massachusetts
Historical Society, in his book entitled "Account of Percival and Ellen
Green and some of their descendants."</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<a name = "pagexi" id = "pagexi"> </a>
<p>Mrs. Joshua Winslow was the oldest of twelve Green children, hence
the vast array of uncles and aunts and cousins in little Anna's
diary.</p>

<p>Joseph Green, Anna's maternal grandfather, was born December 12,
1703, and was baptised on the same day. He died July 11, 1765. He was a
wealthy man for his time, being able to pay Governor Belcher £3,600 for
a tract of land on Hanover Street. His firm name was Green &amp; Walker.
A&nbsp;fine portrait of him by Copley still exists.</p>

<p>Thus Anna came of good stock in all lines of descent. The Pierces
were of the New Hampshire provincial gentry, to which the Wentworths and
Langdons also belonged.</p>

<p>Before Joshua Winslow was married, when he was but eighteen years of
age, he began his soldierly career. He was a Lieutenant in Captain
Light's company in the regiment of Colonel Moore at the taking of
Louisburg in 1745. He was then appointed Commissary-General of the
British forces in Nova Scotia, and an account-book of his daily
movements there still exists. Upon his return to New England he went to
live at Marshfield, Massachusetts, in the house afterwards occupied by
Daniel Webster. But troublous times were now approaching for the
faithful servants of
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "pagexii" id = "pagexii"> </a>
the King. Strange notions of liberty filled the heads of many
Massachusetts men and women; and soon the Revolution became more than a
dream. Joshua Winslow in that crisis, with many of his Marshfield
friends and neighbors, sided with his King.</p>

<p>He was in Marshfield certainly in June, 1775, for I have a letter
before me written to him there by Mrs. Deming at that date. One clause
of this letter is so amusing that I cannot resist quoting it. We must
remember that it was written in Connecticut, whence Mrs. Deming had fled
in fright and dismay at the siege of Boston; and that she had lost her
home and all her possessions. She writes in answer to her brother's
urgent invitation to return to Marshfield.</p>

<p>"We have no household stuff. Neither could I live in the terror of
constant alarms and the din of war. Besides I know not how to look you
in the face, unless I could restore to you your family Expositer, which
together with my Henry on the Bible &amp; Harveys Meditations which are
your daughter's (the gift of her grandmother) I pack'd in a Trunk that
exactly held them, some days before I made my escape, and did my utmost
to git to you, but which I am told are still in Boston. It is not, nor
ever will be in my power
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<a name = "pagexiii" id = "pagexiii"> </a>
to make you Satisfaction for this Error&mdash;I&nbsp;should not have
coveted to keep 'em so long&mdash;I&nbsp;am heartily sorry now that I
had more than one book at a time; in that case I might have thot to have
bro't it away with me, tho' I forgot my own Bible &amp; almost every
other necessary. But who can tell whether you may not git your Valuable
Books. I&nbsp;should feel comparatively easy if you had these your
Valuable property."</p>

<p>Her painful solicitude over the loss of a borrowed book is indeed
refreshing, as well as her surprising covetousness of the Family
Expositor and Harvey's Meditations. And I wish to add to the posthumous
rehabilitation of the damaged credit of this conscientious aunt, that
Anna's book&mdash;Harvey's Meditations&mdash;was recovered and restored
to the owner, and was lost at sea in 1840 by another Winslow.</p>

<p>Joshua Winslow, when exiled, went to England, and thence to Quebec,
where he retained throughout his life his office as Royal Paymaster. He
was separated many years from his wife and daughter, and doubtless Anna
died while her father was far from her; for in a letter dated Quebec,
December 26, 1783, and written to his wife, he says,</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<a name = "pagexiv" id = "pagexiv"> </a>
<p>"The Visiting Season is come on, a&nbsp;great practice here about
Christmas and the New Year; on the return of which I congratulate my
Dearest Anna and Friends with you, it being the fifth and I hope the
last I shall be obliged to see the return of in a Separation from each
other while we may continue upon the same Globe."</p>


<p class = "space">
She shortly after joined him in Quebec. His letters show careful
preparations for her comfort on the voyage. They then were childless;
Anna's brothers, George Scott and John Henry, died in early youth. It is
interesting to note that Joshua Winslow was the first of the Winslows to
give his children more than one baptismal name.</p>

<p>Joshua Winslow was a man of much dignity and of handsome person, if
we can trust the Copley portrait and miniature of him which still exist.
The portrait is owned by Mr. James F. Trott of Niagara Falls, New York,
the miniature by Mrs. J.&nbsp;F. Lindsey of Yorkville, South Carolina,
both grandchildren of General John Winslow. His letters display much
intelligence. His spelling is unusually correct; his penmanship
elegant&mdash;as was that of all the Winslows; his forms of expression
scholarly and careful. He sometimes
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<a name = "pagexv" id = "pagexv"> </a>
could joke a little, as when he began his letters to his wife Anna
thus&mdash;2.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;A.&mdash;though it is possible that the
"Obstructions to a free Correspondence, and the Circumspection we are
obliged to practice in our Converse with each other" arising from his
exiled condition, may have made him thus use a rebus in the address of
his letter.</p>

<p>He died in Quebec in 1801. His wife returned to New England and died
in Medford in 1810. Her funeral was at General John Winslow's house on
Purchase Street, Fort Hill, Boston; she was buried in the Winslow tomb
in King's Chapel burial ground.</p>


<p class = "break">
WE know little of the last years of Anna Green Winslow's life.
A&nbsp;journal written by her mother in 1773 during their life in
Marshfield is now owned by Miss Sarah Thomas of Marshfield, Mass. It is
filled chiefly with pious sermon notes and religious thoughts, and sad
and anxious reflections over absent loved ones, one of whom (in&nbsp;the
sentimental fashion of the times) she calls "my Myron"&mdash;her
husband.</p>

<p>Through this journal we see "Nanny Green's" simple and monotonous
daily life; her little tea-drinkings; her spinning and
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
<a name = "pagexvi" id = "pagexvi"> </a>
reeling and knitting; her frequent catechisings, her country walks. We
find her mother's testimony to the "appearance of reason that is in my
children and for the readiness with which they seem to learn what is
taught them." And though she repeatedly thanks God for living in a warm
house, she notes that "my bason of water froze on the hearth with as
good a fire as we could make in the chimney." This rigor of climate and
discomfort of residence, and Anna's evident delicacy shown through the
records of her fainting, account for her failing health. The last
definite glimpse which we have of our gentle little Nanny is in the
shape of a letter written to her by "Aunt Deming." It is dated Boston,
April 21, 1779, and is so characteristic of the day and so amusing also
that I quote it in full.</p>

<p class = "space">
Dear Neice,</p>

<p class = "deepset">
I receivd your favor of 6<sup>th</sup> instant by nephew Jack, who with
the Col. his trav'ling companion, perform'd an easy journey from you to
us, and arriv'd before sunset. I&nbsp;thank you for the beads, the wire,
and the beugles, I&nbsp;fancy I shall never execute the plan of the head
dress to which you allude&mdash;if I should, some of your largest corn
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
<a name = "pagexvii" id = "pagexvii"> </a>
stalks, dril'd of the pith and painted might be more proportionable.
I&nbsp;rejoice that your cloths came off so much better than my
fears&mdash;a&nbsp;troublesome journey, I&nbsp;expected you would have;
and very much did I fear for your bones. I&nbsp;was always unhappy in
anticipating trouble&mdash;it is my constitution,
I&nbsp;believe&mdash;and when matters have been better than my
fears&mdash;I&nbsp;have never been so dutifully thankful as my bountiful
Benefactor had a right to expect. This, also, I&nbsp;believe, is the
constitution of all my fellow race.</p>

<p>Mr. Deming had a Letter from your Papa yesterday; he mention'd your
Mama &amp; you as indispos'd &amp; Flavia as sick in bed. I'm at too
great a distance to render you the least service, and were I near, too
much out of health to&mdash;some part of the time&mdash;even speak to
you. I&nbsp;am seiz'd with exceeding weakness at the very seat of life,
and to a greater degree than I ever before knew. Could I ride, it might
help me, but that is an exercise my income will not permit. I&nbsp;walk
out whenever I can. The day will surely come, when I must quit this

I&nbsp;am not of importance eno' in this world, for any one to wish my

<p>Our family are well&mdash;had I time and spirits I could acquaint you
of an expedition two sisters made to Dorchester, a&nbsp;walk begun at
sunrise last thursday morning&mdash;dress'd in their dammasks, padusoy,
gauze, ribbins, flapets, flowers, new white hats, white shades, and
black leather shoes, (Pudingtons make) and finished journey, &amp;
garments, orniments, and all quite finish'd on Saturday, before noon,
(mud over shoes) never did I behold such destruction in so short a
space&mdash;bottom of padusoy coat fring'd quite round, besides places
worn entire to floss, &amp; besides frays, dammask, from shoulders to
bottom, not lightly soil'd, but as if every part had rub'd tables and
chairs that had long been us'd to wax mingl'd with grease. I&nbsp;could
have cry'd, for I really pitied 'em&mdash;nothing left fit to be
seen&mdash;They had leave to go, but it never entered any ones tho'ts
but their own to be dressd in all (even to loading) of their
best&mdash;their all, as you know. What signifies it to worry ones
selves about beings that are, and will be, just so? I&nbsp;can, and do
pity and advise, but I shall git no credit by such like. The eldest
talks much of learning dancing, musick (the spinet &amp; guitar),
embroidry, dresden, the
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
<a name = "pagexix" id = "pagexix"> </a>
French tongue &amp;c &amp;c. The younger with an air of her own, advis'd
the elder when she first mention'd French, to learn first to read
English, and was answered "law, so I can well eno' a'ready." You've
heard her do what she calls reading, I&nbsp;believe. Poor creature!
Well! we have a time of&nbsp;it!</p>

<p>If any one at Marshfield speaks of me remember me to them. Nobody
knows I'm writing, each being gone their different ways, &amp; all from
home except the little one who is above stairs. Farewell my dear, I've
wrote eno' I find for this siting.</p>

It does not need great acuteness to read between the lines of this
letter an affectionate desire to amuse a delicate girl whom the writer
loved. The tradition in the Winslow family is that Anna Green Winslow
died of consumption at Marshfield in the fall of 1779. There is no town
or church record of her death, no known grave or headstone to mark her
last resting-place. And to us she is not dead, but lives and
speaks&mdash;always a loving, endearing little child; not so passionate
and gifted and rare a creature as that star among
children&mdash;Marjorie Fleming&mdash;but a natural
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
<a name = "pagexx" id = "pagexx"> </a>
and homely little flower of New England life; fated never to grow old or
feeble or dull or sad, but to live forever and laugh in the glamour of
eternal happy youth through the few pages of her time-stained diary.</p>

<p>Lady, by which means I had a bit of the wedding cake. I&nbsp;guess I
shall have but little time for journalising till after thanksgiving. My
aunt Deming<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =

somebody beside myself will like to eat a bit of my Boston pye thou' my

Cumberland<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =

Praises this morning. Poor Job was forced to praise himself when no

Lord taketh pleasure in his people; he will beautify the meek with
salvation. His Doctrine was something like this, viz: That the Salvation
of Gods people mainly consists in Holiness. The name <i>Jesus</i>
signifies <i>a Savior</i>. Jesus saves his people <i>from their
Sins</i>. He renews them in the spirit of their minds&mdash;writes his
Law in their hearts. Mr. Beacon ask'd a question. What is
beauty&mdash;or, wherein does true beauty consist? He answer'd, in
holiness&mdash;and said a great deal about it that I can't remember,
&amp; as aunt says she hant leisure now to help me any further&mdash;so
I may just tell you a little that I remember without her assistance, and
that I repeated to her yesterday at Tea&mdash;He said he would lastly
address himself to the young people: My dear young friends, you are
pleased with beauty, &amp; like to be tho't beautifull&mdash;but let me
tell ye, you'l never be truly beautifull till you are like the King's
daughter, all glorious within, all the orniments you can put on while
your souls are unholy make you the more like white sepulchres garnish'd
without, but full of deformyty within. You think me very unpolite
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<a name = "page3" id = "page3"> </a>
<!-- png 027 -->
no doubt to address you in this manner, but I must go a little further
and tell you, how cource soever it may sound to your delicacy, that
while you are without holiness, your beauty is deformity&mdash;you are
all over black &amp; defil'd, ugly and loathsome to all holy beings, the
wrath of th' great God lie's upon you, &amp; if you die in this
condition, you will be turn'd into hell, with ugly devils, to
eternity.</p>


<p>Nov. 27th.&mdash;We are very glad to see Mr. Gannett, because of him
"we hear of your affairs &amp; how you do"&mdash;as the apostle Paul
once wrote. My unkle &amp; aunt however, say they are sorry he is to be
absent, so long as this whole winter, I&nbsp;<i>think</i>. I&nbsp;long
now to have you come up&mdash;I&nbsp;want to see papa, mama, &amp;
brother, all most, for I cannot make any distinction which
most&mdash;I&nbsp;should like to see Harry too. Mr. Gannett tells me he
keeps a journal&mdash;I&nbsp;do want to see that&mdash;especially as Mr.
Gannett has given me some specimens, as I may say of his "I and Aunt
&amp;c." I&nbsp;am glad Miss Jane is with you, I&nbsp;will write to her
soon&mdash;Last monday I went with my aunt to visit Mrs. Beacon.
I&nbsp;was
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4" id = "page4"> </a>
<!-- png 028 -->
exceedingly pleased with the visit, &amp; so I <i>ought</i> to be, my
aunt says, for there was much notice taken of me, particylarly by Mr.
Beacon. I&nbsp;think I like him better every time I see him.
I&nbsp;suppose he takes the kinder notice of me, because last thursday
evening he was here, &amp; when I was out of the room, aunt told him
that I minded his preaching &amp; could repeat what he
said&mdash;I&nbsp;might have told you that notwithstanding the stir
about the Proclamatien, we had an agreable Thanksgiven. Mr. Hunt's<a

Psa. xcvii. 1.&nbsp;The <span class = "smallcaps">Lord</span>
reigneth,&mdash;let the earth rejoice. Mr. Beacon's text P&nbsp;M Psa.
xxiv.&nbsp;1. The earth is the <span class = "smallcaps">Lord</span>'s
&amp; the fulness thereof. My unkle &amp; aunt Winslow<a class = "tag"

&amp; daughter, Master Daniel Mason (Aunt Winslows nephew from Newport,
Rhode Island) &amp; Miss Soley<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6"
href = "#note6">6</a> spent the evening with us. We young folk had a
room with a fire in it to ourselves. Mr Beacon gave us his company for
one hour. I&nbsp;spent Fryday with my friends in Sudbury Street.
I&nbsp;saw Mrs. Whitwell<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href

Mamma, by Mr. Gannett, &amp; heartily thank you for the broad cloath,
bags, ribbin &amp; hat. The cloath &amp; bags are both at work upon,
&amp; my aunt has bought a beautifull ermin trimming for my cloak. AC
stands for Abigail Church. PF for Polly Frazior. I&nbsp;have presented
one piece of ribbin to my aunt as you directed. She gives her love to
you, &amp; thanks you for it. I&nbsp;intend to send Nancy Mackky a pair
of lace mittens, &amp; the fag end of Harry's watch string. I&nbsp;hope
Carolus (as&nbsp;papa us'd to call him) will think his daughter very
smart with them. I&nbsp;am glad Hon<sup>d</sup> madam, that you think my
writing is better than it us'd to be&mdash;you see it is mended just
here. I&nbsp;dont know what you mean by <i>terrible margins vaze</i>.
I&nbsp;will endeavor to make my letters even for the future. Has Mary
brought me any Lozong Mamma? I&nbsp;want to know whether I may give my
old black quilt to Mrs Kuhn, for aunt sais, it is never worth while to
take the pains to mend it again. Papa has wrote me a longer letter this
time than you have Mad<sup>m</sup>.</p>

scribling daughter. She hopes if I live 12 years longer that I shall
write and do everything better than can be expected in the <i>past</i>

<p>Miss Attwood as well as Miss Winslow are of this family. And Miss
N.&nbsp;Glover did me honor by her presence, for she is older than
cousin Sally and of her acquaintance. We made four couple at country

prevented. The black Hatt I gratefully receive as your present, but if
Captain Jarvise had arrived here with it about the time he sail'd from
this place for Cumberland it would have been of more service to me, for
I have been oblig'd to borrow. I&nbsp;wore Miss Griswold's<a class =

put on my red cloak &amp; black hatt&mdash;I&nbsp;hope aunt wont let me
wear the black hatt with the red Dominie&mdash;for the people will ask
me what I have got to sell as I go along street if I do, or, how the
folk at New guinie do? Dear mamma, you dont know the fation
here&mdash;I&nbsp;beg to look like other folk. You dont know what a stir

I&nbsp;spent some part of yesterday afternoon and evening at Mr.

<p>Dec 14th.&mdash;The weather and walking have been very winter like
since the above hotch-potch, pothooks &amp; trammels. I&nbsp;went to
Mrs. Whitwell's last wednessday&mdash;you taught me to spell the 4 day
of the week, but my aunt says that it should be spelt wednesday. My aunt
also says, that till I come out of an egregious fit of laughterre that
is apt to sieze me &amp; the violence of which I am at this present
under, neither English sense, nor anything rational may be expected of
me. I&nbsp;ment to say, that, I&nbsp;went to Mrs. Whitwell's to see
Mad<sup>m</sup> Storers<a class = "tag" name = "tag18" id = "tag18" href
= "#note18">18</a> funeral, the walking was very bad except on the sides
of the street which was the reason I did not make a part of the
procession. I&nbsp;should have dined with Mrs. Whitwell on thursday if a
grand storm had not prevented, As she invited me. I&nbsp;saw Miss Caty
Vans<a class = "tag" name = "tag19" id = "tag19" href = "#note19">19</a>
at lecture last evening. I&nbsp;had a visit this morning from Mrs Dixon
of Horton &amp; Miss Polly Huston. Mrs Dixon is dissipointed at not
finding her sister here.</p>


<p>Dec<sup>r</sup> 24th.&mdash;Elder Whitwell told my aunt, that this
winter began as did the Winter of 1740. How that was I dont remember but
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>

<!-- png 034 -->
this I know, that to-day is by far the coldest we have had since I have
been in New England. (N.B.&nbsp;All run that are abroad.) Last sabbath
being rainy I went to &amp; from meeting in Mr. Soley's chaise.
I&nbsp;dined at unkle Winslow's, the walking being so bad I rode there
&amp; back to meeting. Every drop that fell froze, so that from
yesterday morning to this time the appearance has been similar to the
discription I sent you last winter. The walking is so slippery &amp; the
air so cold, that aunt chuses to have me for her scoller these two days.
And as tomorrow will be a holiday, so the pope and his associates have
ordained,<a class = "tag" name = "tag20" id = "tag20" href =

week. I&nbsp;began a shift at home yesterday for myself, it is pretty
forward. Last Saturday was seven-night my aunt Suky<a class = "tag" name

little son, who was baptiz'd by Dr. Cooper<a class = "tag" name =

Charles. I&nbsp;knew nothing of it till noonday, when I went there a
visiting. Last Thursday I din'd &amp; spent the afternoon at unkle

Hunt preach, but

she would not wait till I came from writing school. Miss Atwood, the
last of our boarders, went off the same day. Miss Griswold &amp; Miss
Meriam, having departed some time agone, I&nbsp;forget whether I
mention'd the recept of Nancy's present. I&nbsp;am oblig'd to her for
it. The Dolphin is still whole. And like to remain&nbsp;so.</p>

I&nbsp;spent the most part of Tuesday evening with my favorite, Miss

<p>Hon<sup>'d</sup> Mamma, My Hon<sup>'d</sup> Papa has never signified
to me his approbation of my journals, from whence I infer, that he
either never reads them, or does not give himself the trouble to
remember any of their contents, tho' some part has been address'd to
him, so, for the future, I&nbsp;shall trouble only you with this part of
my scribble&mdash;Last thursday I din'd at Unkle Storer's &amp; spent
the afternoon in that neighborhood. I&nbsp;met with some adventures in
my way viz. As I was going, I&nbsp;was overtaken by a lady who was quite
a stranger to me. She accosted me with "how do you do miss?"
I&nbsp;answer'd
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>

her, but told her I had not the pleasure of knowing her. She then ask'd
"what is your name miss? I&nbsp;believe you think 'tis a very strange
questian to ask, but have a mind to know." Nanny Green&mdash;She
interrupted me with "not Mrs. Winslow of Cumberland's daughter." Yes
madam I am. When did you hear from your Mamma? how do's she do? When
shall you write to her? When you do, tell her that you was overtaken in
the street by her old friend Mrs Login, give my love to her &amp; tell
her she must come up soon &amp; live on Jamaca plain. we have got a nice
meeting-house, &amp; a charming minister, &amp; all so cleaver. She told
me she had ask'd Unkle Harry to bring me to see her, &amp; he said he
would. Her minister is Mr Gordon. I&nbsp;have heard him preach several
times at the O.&nbsp;South. In the course of my peregrination, as aunt
calls it, I&nbsp;happen'd in to a house where D&mdash;&mdash; was
attending the Lady of the family. How long she was at his opperation,
I&nbsp;know not. I&nbsp;saw him twist &amp; tug &amp; pick &amp; cut off
whole locks of grey hair at a slice (the lady telling him she would have
no hair to dress next time) for

excuse my useing the pen of my old friend just here, because I am
disabled by a whitloe on my fourth finger &amp; something like one on my
middle finger, from using my own pen; but altho' my right hand is in

oppertunity if I do but improve it, to perfect myself in learning to

exerting myself for this purpose. I&nbsp;hope, when two, or at most
three months are past, to give you occular demonstration

of my proficiency in <i>this art</i>, as well as several others. My
fingers are not the only part of me that has suffer'd with sores within
this fortnight, for I have had an ugly great boil upon my right hip
&amp; about a dozen small ones&mdash;I&nbsp;am at present swath'd hip
&amp; thigh, as Samson smote the Philistines, but my soreness is near
over. My aunt thought it highly proper to give me some cooling physick,
so last tuesday I took 1-2 oz Globe Salt (a&nbsp;disagreeable potion)
&amp; kept chamber. Since which, there has been no new erruption, &amp;
a great alteration for the better in those I had before.</p>

<p>I have read my bible to my aunt this morning (as&nbsp;is the daily
custom) &amp; sometimes I read other books to her. So you may perceive,
I&nbsp;<i>have the use of my tongue</i> &amp; I tell her it is a good

Aunt's easy chair, with a tall three leav'd screen at my back, &amp; I
am very comfortable. I&nbsp;took my second (&amp;&nbsp;I hope last)
potion of Globe salts this morning. I&nbsp;went to see Aunt Storer
yesterday afternoon, &amp; by the way Unkle Storer is so ill that he
keeps chamber. As I went down I call'd at Mrs Whitwell's &amp; must tell
you Mr &amp; Mrs Whitwell are both ill. Mrs. Whitwell with the
rheumatism. I&nbsp;saw Mad<sup>m</sup> Harris, Mrs Mason and Miss Polly
Vans<a class = "tag" name = "tag47" id = "tag47" href = "#note47">47</a>
there, they all give their love to you&mdash;Last evening I went to
catechizing with Aunt. Our ministers
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
<!-- png 049 -->
have agreed during the long evenings to discourse upon the questions or
some of 'em in the assembly's shorter catechism, taking 'em in their
order at the house of Mrs Rogers in School Street, every wednesday
evening. Mr. Hunt began with the first question and shew'd what it is to
glorify <span class = "smallcaps">God</span>. Mr Bacon then took the
second, what rule &amp;c. which he has spent three evenings upon, &amp;
now finished. Mr Hunt having taken his turn to show what the Scriptures
principly teach, &amp; what is <span class = "smallcaps">God</span>.
I&nbsp;remember he said that there was nothing properly done without a
rule, &amp; he said that the rule God had given us to glorify him by was
the bible. How miraculously (said&nbsp;he) has God preserv'd this
blessed book. It was once in the reign of a heathen emperor condemn'd to
be burnt, at which time it was death to have a bible &amp; conceal it,
but God's providence was wonderful in preserving it when so much human
policy had been exerted to bury it in Oblivion&mdash;but for all that,
here we have it as pure &amp; uncorrupted as ever&mdash;many books of
human composure have had much pains taken to preserve 'em,
notwithstanding they
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25" id = "page25"> </a>
<!-- png 050 -->
are buried in Oblivion. He considered who was the author of the bible,
he prov'd that <span class = "smallcaps">God</span> was the author, for
no <i>good</i> man could be the author, because such a one would not be
guilty of imposition, &amp; an evil man could not unless we suppose a
house divided against itself. he said a great deal more to prove the
bible is certainly the word of God from the matter it contains &amp;c,
but the best evidence of the truth of divine revelation, every true
believer has in his own heart. This he said, the natural man had no idea
of. I&nbsp;did not understand all he said about the external and
internal evidence, but this I can say, that I understand him better than
any body else that I hear preach. Aunt has been down stairs all the time
I have been recolecting &amp; writeing this. Therefore, all this of own
head, of consequence.</p>

<p>Valentine day.<a class = "tag" name = "tag48" id = "tag48" href =

yarn today. My valentine was an old country plow-joger. The yarn was of
my spinning. Aunt says it will do for filling. Aunt also says niece is a
whimsical child.</p>


<p>Feb. 17.&mdash;Since Wednesday evening, I
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<a name = "page26" id = "page26"> </a>
<!-- png 051 -->
have not been abroad since yesterday afternoon. I&nbsp;went to meeting
&amp; back in Mr. Soley's chaise. Mr. Hunt preached. He said that human
nature is as opposite to God as darkness to light. That our sin is only
bounded by the narrowness of our capacity. His text was Isa. xli. 14.
18. The mountains &amp;c. He said were unbelief, pride, covetousness,
enmity, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. This morning I took a walk for Aunt as
far as Mr. Soley's. I&nbsp;called at Mrs Whitwell's &amp; found the good
man &amp; lady both better than when I saw them last. On my return I
found Mr. Hunt on a visit to aunt. After the usual salutations &amp;
when did you hear from your papa &amp;c. I&nbsp;ask'd him if the
blessing pronounced by the minister before the congregation is
dismissed, is not a part of the publick worship? "Yes."</p>

<p>"Why then, do you Sir, say, let us conclude the publick worship by
singing?" "Because singing is the last act in which the whole
congregation is unanimously to join. The minister in Gods name blesses
his i.e. Gods people agreeable to the practice of the apostles, who
generally close the
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
<!-- png 052 -->
epistles with a benediction in the name of the Trinity, to which, Amen
is subjoined, which, tho' pronounc'd by the minister, is, or ought to be
the sentiment &amp; prayer of the whole assembly, the meaning whereof
is, So be&nbsp;it."</p>


<p>Feb. 18<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;Another ten knot skane of my yarn was
reel'd off today. Aunt says it is very good. My boils &amp; whitloes are
growing well apace, so that I can knit a little in the evening.</p>

walk'd all that long way. Thursday last I din'd &amp; spent the
afternoon with Aunt Sukey. I&nbsp;attended both my schools in the
morning of that day. I&nbsp;cal'd at unkle Joshua's as I went along, as
I generally do, when I go in town, it being all in my way. Saterday I
din'd at Unkle Storer's, drank tea at Cousin Barrel's, was entertain'd
in the afternoon with scating. Unkle Henry was there. Yesterday by the
help of neighbor Soley's Chaise, I&nbsp;was at meeting all day, tho' it
snow'd in the afternoon. I&nbsp;might have say'd I was at Unkle
Winslow's last Thursday Eve<sup>g</sup> &amp; when I inform you that my
needle work at school, &amp; knitting at home, went on <i>as usual</i>,

Thursday.</span>
This day Jack Frost bites very hard, so hard aunt won't let me go to any
school. I&nbsp;have this morning made part of a coppy with the very pen
I have now in my hand, writting this with. Yesterday was so cold there
was a very thick vapor upon the water, but I attended my schools all
day. My unkle says yesterday was 10 degrees colder than any day we have
had before this winter. And my aunt says she believes this day is 10
degrees colder than it was yesterday; &amp; moreover, that she would not
put a dog out of doors. The sun gives forth his rays through a vapor
like that which was upon the water yesterday. But Aunt bids me give her
love to pappa &amp; all the family &amp; tell them that she should be
glad of their company in her warm parlour, indeed there is not one room
in this house but is very warm when there is a good fire in them. As
there is in this at present. Yesterday I got leave (by&nbsp;my aunt's
desire) to go from school at 4 o'clock to see my unkle Ned who has had
the misfortune to break his leg. I&nbsp;call'd in to warm myself at
unkle Joshua's. Aunt Hannah told
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
<!-- png 055 -->
me I had better not go any further for she could tell me all about him,
so I say'd as it is so cold I believe aunt won't be angry so I will
stay, I&nbsp;therefore took off my things, aunt gave me leave to call at
Unkle Joshua's &amp; was very glad I went no further. Aunt Hannah told
me he was as well as could be expected for one that has a broken bone.
He was coming from Watertown in a chaise the horse fell down on the
Hill, this side Mr Brindley's. he was afraid if he fell out, the wheel
would run over him, he therefore gave a start &amp; fell out &amp; broke
his leg, the horse strugled to get up, but could not. unkle Ned was
affraid if he did get up the chaise wheels would run over him, so he
went on his two hands and his other foot drawing his lame leg after him
&amp; got behind the chaise, (so&nbsp;he was safe) &amp; there lay in
the snow for some time, nobody being near. at last 2 genteelmen came,
they tho't the horse was dead when they first saw him at a distance, but
hearing somebody hollow, went up to it. By this time there was a
countraman come along, the person that hollow'd was unkle Ned. They got
a slay and
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page31" id = "page31"> </a>
<!-- png 056 -->
put him in it with some hay and a blanket, wrapt him up well as they
could &amp; brought him to Deacon Smith's in town. Now Papa &amp; Mamma,
this hill is in Brookline. And now again, I&nbsp;have been better
inform'd for the hill is in Roxbury &amp; poor Unkle Ned was alone in
the chaise. Both bones of his leg are broke, but they did not come thro'

broke. My Grandmamma sent Miss Deming, Miss Winslow &amp; I one
eight<sup>th</sup> of a Dollar a piece for a New Years gift. My Aunt
Deming &amp; Miss Deming had letters from Grandmamma. She was pretty
well, she wrote aunt that Mrs Marting was brought to bed with a son
Joshua about a month since, &amp; is with her son very well. Grandmamma
was very well last week. I&nbsp;have made the purchase I told you of a
few pages agone, that is, last Thursday I purchas'd with my aunt
Deming's leave, a&nbsp;very beautiful white feather hat, that is, the
out side, which is a bit of white hollond with the feathers sew'd on in
a most curious manner white &amp; unsullyed as the falling snow, this
hat I have long been saving my money to
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32" id = "page32"> </a>
<!-- png 057 -->
procure for which I have let your kind allowance, Papa, lay in my aunt's
hands till this hat which I spoke for was brought home. As I am
(as&nbsp;we say) a daughter of liberty<a class = "tag" name = "tag49" id

manufactory as pocible. But my aunt says, I&nbsp;have wrote this account
very badly. I&nbsp;will go on to save my money for a chip &amp; a
lineing &amp;c.</p>

<p>Papa I rec'd your letter dated Jan. 11, for which I thank you, Sir,
&amp; thank you greatly for the money I received therewith. I&nbsp;am
very glad to hear that Brother John papa &amp; mamma &amp; cousin are
well. I'll answer your letter papa and yours mamma and cousin Harry's
too. I&nbsp;am very glad mamma your eyes are better. I&nbsp;hope by the
time I have the pleasure of hearing from Cumberland again your eyes will
be so well that you will favor me with one from you.</p>


<p>Feb. 22<sup>d</sup>.&mdash;Since about the middle of December, ult.
we have had till this week, a&nbsp;series of cold and stormy
weather&mdash;every snow storm (of&nbsp;which we have had abundance)
except the first, ended with rain, by which means the snow was so
hardened that
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<a name = "page33" id = "page33"> </a>
<!-- png 058 -->
strong gales at NW soon turned it, &amp; all above ground to ice, which
this day seven-night was from one to three, four &amp; they say, in some
places, five feet thick, in the streets of this town. Last saturday
morning we had a snow storm come on, which continued till four o'clock
P.M. when it turned to rain, since which we have had a warm air, with
many showers of rain, one this morning a little before day attended with
thunder. The streets have been very wet, the water running like rivers
all this week, so that I could not possibly go to school, neither have I
yet got the bandage off my fingure. Since I have been writing now, the
wind suddenly sprung up at NW and blew with violence so that we may get
to meeting to-morrow, perhaps on dry ground. Unkle Ned was here just now
&amp; has fairly or unfairly carried off aunt's cut paper pictures,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag50" id = "tag50" href = "#note50">50</a> tho'
she told him she had given them to papa some years ago. It has been a
very sickly time here, not one person that I know of but has been under
heavy colds&mdash;(all laid up at unkle Storer's) in general got abroad
again. Aunt Suky had not been

down stairs since her lying in, when I last saw her, but I hear she is
got down. She has had a broken breast. I&nbsp;have spun 30 knots of
linning yarn, and (partly) new footed a pair of stockings for Lucinda,
read a part of the pilgrim's progress, coppied part of my text journal
(that if I live a few years longer, I&nbsp;may be able to understand it,
for aunt sais, that to her, the contents as I first mark'd them, were an
impenetrable secret) play'd some, tuck'd a great deal (Aunt Deming says
it is very true) laugh'd enough, &amp; I tell aunt it is all human

mamma a very good night.</p>

Dear Pappa, do's the winter continue as pleasant at Cumberland as when
you wrote to me last? We had but very little winter here, till February
came in, but we have little else since. The cold still continues tho'
not so extreme as it was last Thursday. I&nbsp;have attended my schools
all this week except one day, and am going as soon as I have din'd to
see how Unkle Ned does. I&nbsp;was thinking, Sir, to lay up a piece of
money you sent me, but
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>

as you sent it to me to lay out I have a mind to buy a chip &amp;
linning for my feather hatt. But my aunt says she will think of it. My
aunt says if I behave myself very well indeed, not else, she will give
me a garland of flowers to orniment it, tho' she has layd aside the
biziness of flower making.<a class = "tag" name = "tag51" id = "tag51"

<p>Feb. 25<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;This is a very stormy day of snow, hail
&amp; rain, so that I cannot get to Master Holbrook's, therefore I will
here copy something I lately transcribed on a loose paper from Dr.
Owen's sermon on Hab. iii, 1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3, 4,&nbsp;5, 6,&nbsp;7,
8,&nbsp;9. "I&nbsp;have heard that a full wind behind the ship drives
her not so fast forward, as a side wind, that seems almost as much
against her as with her; &amp; the reason they say is, because a full
wind fills but some of her sails.</p>


<p>Wednesday.&mdash;Very cold, but this morning I was at sewing and
writing school, this afternoon all sewing, for Master Holbrook does not
in the winter keep school of afternoons. Unkle Henrys feet are so much
better that he wears shoos now.

I&nbsp;have been to writing school this morning and Sewing. The day
being very pleasant, very little wind stirring. Jemima called to see me
last evening. She lives at Master Jimmy Lovel's.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag52" id = "tag52" href = "#note52">52</a> Dear mamma, I&nbsp;suppose
that you would be glad to hear that Betty Smith who has given you so
much trouble, is well &amp; behaves herself well &amp; I should be glad
if I could write you so. But the truth is, no sooner was the 29th
Regiment encamp'd upon the common but miss Betty took herself among them
(as&nbsp;the Irish say) &amp; there she stay'd with Bill Pinchion &amp;
awhile. The next news of her was, that she was got into gaol for
stealing: from whence she was taken to the publick whipping post.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag53" id = "tag53" href = "#note53">53</a> The

from there, she came up to town again, and soon got into the workhouse
for new misdemeanours, she soon ran away from there and sit up her old
trade of pilfering again, for which she was put a second time into gaol,
there she still remains. About

<!-- png 063 -->
two months agone (as&nbsp;well as I can remember) she &amp; a number of
her wretched companions set the gaol on fire, in order to get out, but
the fire was timely discovered &amp; extinguished, &amp; there, as I
said she still remains till this day, in order to be tried for her
crimes. I&nbsp;heard somebody say that as she has some connections with
the army no doubt but she would be cleared, and perhaps, have a pension
into the bargain. Mr. Henry says the way of sin is down hill, when
persons get into that way they are not easily stopped.</p>


<p>Feb. 27.&mdash;This day being too stormy for me to go to any school,
and nothing as yet having happen'd that is worth your notice, my aunt
gives me leave to communicate to you something that much pleas'd her
when she heard of it, &amp; which I hope will please you my Papa and
Mamma. I&nbsp;believe I may have inform'd you that since I have been in
Boston, Dr. Byles<a class = "tag" name = "tag55" id = "tag55" href =

administer'd the sacrament, when our Candidates have preached to the

Gospel Ordinance,

till they be settled Pastours. About two months ago a brother of the
church sent Dr Byles a Card which contain'd after the usual
introduction, the following words, Mr W&mdash;&mdash; dont set up for an
Expositor of Scripture, yet ventures to send Dr. Byles a short comment
on 1 Cor. ix. 11. which he thinks agreeable to the genuine import of the
text, &amp; hopes the Dr will not disapprove it. The comment was a dozen
pounds of Chocolate &amp;c.&mdash;To which the D<sup>r</sup> return'd
the following very pretty answer. D<sup>r</sup> Byles returns respects
to Mr W &amp; most heartily thanks him for his judicious practical
Familie Expositor, which is in Tast. My aunt Deming gives her love to
you mamma, and bids me tell you, as a matter you will be very glad to
know, that D<sup>r</sup> Byles &amp; his lady &amp; family, have enjoy'd
a good share of health &amp; perfect harmony for several years past.</p>

<p>Mr Beacon is come home. My unkle Neddy is very comfortable, has very

class = "tag" name = "tag56" id = "tag56" href = "#note56">56</a> was
here yesterday &amp; is very well. Poor Mrs Inches is dangerously ill of
a fever. We have not heard how she does today.

<p>March 4<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;Poor Mrs Inches is dead. Gone from a
world of trouble, as she has left this to her poor mother. Aunt says she
heartyly pities Mrs Jackson. Mr Nat. Bethune died this morning, Mrs
Inches last night.</p>

<p>We had the greatest fall of snow yesterday we have had this winter.
Yet cousin Sally, miss Polly, &amp; I rode to &amp; from meeting in Mr
Soley's chaise both forenoon &amp; afternoon, &amp; with a stove<a class
= "tag" name = "tag57" id = "tag57" href = "#note57">57</a> was very
comfortable there. If brother John is as well and hearty as cousin
Frank, he is a clever boy. Unkle Neddy continues very comfortable.
I&nbsp;saw him last saturday. I&nbsp;have just now been writing four
lines in my Book almost as well as the copy. But all the intreaties in
the world will not prevail upon me to do always as well as I can, which
is not the least trouble to me, tho' its a great grief to aunt Deming.
And she says by writing so frightfully above.</p>


<p>March 6.&mdash;I&nbsp;think the appearance this morning is as
winterish as any I can remember, earth, houses, trees, all covered with
snow, which began to fall yesterday morning
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page40" id = "page40"> </a>
<!-- png 066 -->
&amp; continued falling all last night. The Sun now shines very bright,
the N.W. wind blows very fresh. Mr Gannett din'd here yesterday, from
him, my unkle, aunt &amp; cousin Sally, I&nbsp;had an account of
yesterday's publick performances,<a class = "tag" name = "tag58" id =
"tag58" href = "#note58">58</a> &amp; exhibitions, but aunt says I need
not write about 'em because, no doubt there will be printed accounts.
I&nbsp;should have been glad if I could have seen &amp; heard for
myselfe. My face is better, but I have got a heavy cold yet.</p>


<p>March 9<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;After being confined a week, I&nbsp;rode
yesterday afternoon to &amp; from meeting in Mr Soley's chaise.
I&nbsp;got no cold and am pretty well today. This has been a very snowy
day today. Any body that sees this may see that I have wrote nonsense
but Aunt says, I&nbsp;have been a very good girl to day about my work
however&mdash;I&nbsp;think this day's work may be called a piece meal
for in the first place I sew'd on the bosom of unkle's shirt, mended two
pair of gloves, mended for the wash two handkerchiefs, (one cambrick)
sewed on half a border of a lawn apron of aunts, read part of the
xxi<sup>st</sup> chapter of Exodous, &amp; a story in the Mother's gift.

Now, Hon<sup>d</sup> Mamma, I&nbsp;must tell you of something that
happened to me to-day, that has not happen'd before this great while,
viz My Unkle &amp; Aunt both told me, I&nbsp;was a very good girl. Mr
Gannett gave us the favour of his company a little while this morning
(our head). I&nbsp;have been writing all the above gibberish while aunt
has been looking after her family&mdash;now she is out of the
room&mdash;now she is in&mdash;&amp; takes up my pen in <i>my</i>
absence to observe, I&nbsp;am a little simpleton for informing my mamma,
that it is <i>a great while</i> since I was prais'd because she will
conclude that it is <i>a great while</i> since I deserv'd to be prais'd.
I&nbsp;will henceforth try to observe their praise &amp; yours too.
I&nbsp;mean deserve. It's now tea time&mdash;as soon as that is over,
I&nbsp;shall spend the rest of the evening in reading to my aunt. It is
near candle lighting.</p>


<p>March 10, 5&nbsp;o'clock P.M.&mdash;I&nbsp;have finish'd my stent of
sewing work for this day &amp; wrote a billet to Miss Caty Vans,
a&nbsp;copy of which I shall write on the next page. To-morrow if the
weather is fit I am to visit. I&nbsp;have again been told I was a good
girl.
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<a name = "page42" id = "page42"> </a>
<!-- png 068 -->
My Billet to Miss Vans was in the following words. Miss Green gives her
compliments to Miss Vans, and informs her that her aunt Deming quite
misunderstood the matter about the queen's night-Cap.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag59" id = "tag59" href = "#note59">59</a> Mrs. Deming thou't
that it was a black skull cap linn'd with red that Miss Vans ment which
she thou't would not be becoming to Miss Green's light complexion. Miss
Green now takes the liberty to send the materials for the Cap Miss Vans
was so kind as to say she would make for her, which, when done, she
engages to take special care of for Miss Vans' sake. Mrs. Deming joins
her compliments with Miss Green's&mdash;they both wish for the pleasure
of a visit from Miss Vans. Miss Soley is just come in to visit me &amp;
'tis near dark.</p>


<p>March 11.&mdash;Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not
what a day may bring forth. Thus king Solomon, inspired by the Holy
Ghost, cautions, Pro. xxvii. 1.&nbsp;My aunt says, this is a most
necessary lesson to be learn'd &amp; laid up in the heart. I&nbsp;am
quite of her mind. I&nbsp;have met with a disappointment to day, &amp;
aunt says, I&nbsp;may look

for them every day&mdash;we live in a changing world&mdash;in scripture
call'd a vale of tears. Uncle said yesterday that there had not been so
much snow on the ground this winter as there was then&mdash;it has been
vastly added to since then, &amp; is now 7 feet deep in some places
round this house; it is above the fence in the coart &amp; thick snow
began to fall and condtinu'd till about 5 o'clock P.M. (it&nbsp;is about
1-4 past 8 o'clock) since which there has been a steady rain&mdash;so no
visiting as I hoped this day, &amp; this is the disappointment I
mentioned on t'other page. Last saturday I sent my cousin Betsy Storer a
Billet of which the following is a copy. Miss Green gives her love to
Miss Storer &amp; informs her that she is very <i>sensible</i> of the
effects of a bad cold, not only in the pain she has had in her throat,
neck and face, which have been much swell'd &amp; which she is not quite
clear of, but that she has also been by the same depriv'd of the
pleasure of seeing Miss Storer &amp; her other friends in Sudbury
Street. She begs, her Duty, Love &amp; Compliments, may be presented as
due &amp; that she may be inform'd if they be in health.

To this I have receiv'd no answer. I&nbsp;suppose she don't think I am
worth an answer. But I have finished my stent, and wrote all under this
date, &amp; now I have just daylight eno' to add, my love and duty to
dear friends at <i>Cumberland</i>.</p>

what, <i>that</i> I mean, he din'd with us. Aunt Suky's Charles is a
pretty little boy &amp; grows nicely. We were diverted in the afternoon
with an account of a queer Feast that had been made that day in a
certain Court of this town for

the Entertainment of a number of Tories&mdash;perhaps seventeen. One
contain'd three calves heads (skin off) with their appurtinencies

contain'd a number of roast fowls&mdash;half a dozen, we suppose,<a

roosters at this season no doubt. Yesterday, soon after I came from
writing school we had another snow storm begun, which continued till
after I went to bed. This morning the sun shines clear (so&nbsp;it did
yesterday morning till 10 o'clock.) It is now bitter cold, &amp; such a
quantity of snow upon the ground, as the Old people don't remember ever
to have seen before at this time of the year. My aunt Deming says, when
she first look'd abroad this morning she felt anxious for her brother,
&amp; his family at Cumberland, fearing lest they were covered up in
snow. It is now 1-2 after 12 o'clock noon. The sun has been shineing in
his full strength for full 6 hours, &amp; the snow not melted enough
anywhere in sight of this house, to cause one drop of water.</p>

aunt Polly, &amp; finding her going out, I&nbsp;spent the afternoon with
aunt Hannah. While I was out, a&nbsp;snow storm overtook me. This being
a fine sun shine (tho' cold) day I have been to writing school, &amp;
wrote two pieces, one I presented to aunt Deming, and the other I design
for my Honor'd Papa, I&nbsp;hope he will approve of it. I&nbsp;sent a
piece of my writing to you Hon'd Mamma last fall, which I hope you
receiv'd. When my aunt Deming was a little girl my Grandmamma Sargent
told her the following story viz. One Mr. Calf who had three times
enjoy'd the Mayorality of the city of London, had after his decease,
a&nbsp;monoment erected to his memory with the following inscription
on&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "poem pair">

<p>My aunt told me the foregoing some time since &amp; today I ask'd her
leave to insert it in my journal. My aunt gives her love to you &amp;
directs me to tell you that she tho't my piece of linnin would have made
me a dozen of shifts but she could cut no more than ten out of it. There
is some left, but not enough for another. Nine of them are finish'd
wash'd &amp; iron'd; &amp; the other would have been long since done if
my fingers had not been sore. My cousin Sally made three of them for me,
but then I made two shirts &amp; part of another for unkle to help her.
I&nbsp;believe unless something remarkable should happen, such as a
<i>warm day</i>, my mamma will consent that I dedicate a few of my next

<p>The poetry I transcrib'd from my Copy Book.</p>


<p>March 19.&mdash;Thursday last I spent at home, except a quarter of an
hour between sunset and dark, I&nbsp;stepped over the way to Mr.
Glover's with aunt. Yesterday I spent at Unkle Neddy's &amp; stitched
wristbands for aunt Polly. By the way, I&nbsp;must inform you, (pray
dont let papa see this) that yesterday I put on No 1 of my new shifts,
&amp; indeed it is very comfortable. It is <i>long</i> since I had a
shift to my <i>back</i>. I&nbsp;dont know if I ever had till
now&mdash;It seem'd so strange too, to have any linen below my
waist&mdash;I&nbsp;am going to dine at Mrs. Whitwell's to day, by
invitation. I&nbsp;spent last evening at Mrs Rogers. Mr Hunt discoursed
upon the doctrine of the Trinity&mdash;it was the second time that he
spoke upon the subject at that place. I&nbsp;did not hear him the first
time. His business last eve<sup>g</sup> was to prove the divinity of the
Son, &amp; holy Ghost, &amp; their equality with the Father. My aunt

of Thursday last, at Mrs Whitwell's. Mrs Lathrop, &amp; Mrs Carpenter
din'd there also. The latter said she was formerly acquainted with
mamma, ask'd how she did, &amp; when I heard from her,&mdash;said,
I&nbsp;look'd much like her. Madam Harris &amp; Miss P.&nbsp;Vans were
also of the company. While I was abroad the snow melted to such a
degree, that my aunt was oblig'd to get Mr Soley's chaise to bring me
home. Yesterday, we had by far the gratest storm of wind &amp; snow that
there has been this winter. It began to fall yesterday morning &amp;
continued falling till after our family were in bed. (P.M.) Mr. Hunt
call'd in to visit us just after we rose from diner; he ask'd me,
whether I had heard from my papa &amp; mamma, since I wrote 'em. He was
answer'd, no sir, it would be strange if I had, because I had been
writing to 'em today, &amp; indeed so I did every day. Aunt told him
that <i>his name</i> went frequently into my journals together with

afforded much entertainment &amp; would be a future benefit &amp;c. Here
is a fine compliment for me mamma.</p>


<p>March 26.&mdash;Yesterday at 6 o'clock, I&nbsp;went to Unkle
Winslow's, their neighbor Greenleaf was their. She said she knew Mamma,
&amp; that I look like her. Speaking about papa &amp; you occation'd
Unkle Winslow to tell me that he had kiss'd you long before papa knew
you. From thence we went to Miss Rogers's where, to a full assembly Mr
Bacon read his 3<sup>d</sup> sermon on R. iv. 6,&nbsp;I can remember he
said, that, before we all sinned in Adam our father, Christ loved us. He
said the Son of God always did as his father gave him commandment, &amp;
to prove this, he said, that above 17 hundred years ago he left the
bosom of the Father, &amp; came &amp; took up his abode with men, &amp;
bore all the scourgings &amp; buffetings which the vile Jews inflicted
on him, &amp; then was hung upon the accursed tree&mdash;he died, was
buried, &amp; in three days rose again&mdash;ascended up to heaven &amp;
there took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high from whence
he will come to be the supream and impartial

judge of quick &amp; dead&mdash;and when his poor Mother &amp; her poor
husband went to Jerusalem to keep the passover &amp; he went with them,
he disputed among the doctors, &amp; when his Mother ask'd him about it
he said "wist ye not that I must be about my Father's
business,"&mdash;all this he said was a part of that wrighteousness for
the sake of which a sinner is justafied&mdash;Aunt has been up stairs
all the time I have been writeing &amp; recollecting this&mdash;so no
help from her. She is come down now &amp; I have been reading this over
to her. She sais, she is glad I remember so much, but I have not done
the subject justice. She sais I have blended things somewhat
improperly&mdash;an interuption by company.</p>


<p>March 28.&mdash;Unkle Harry was here last evening &amp; inform'd us
that by a vessel from Halifax which arriv'd yesterday, Mr H Newton,
inform'd his brother Mr J Newton of the sudden death of their brother
Hibbert in your family 21 January ult. (Just five months to a day since
Grandmamma Sargent's death.) With all the circumstances relating to it.
My aunt Deming gives her
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<a name = "page52" id = "page52"> </a>
<!-- png 079 -->
love to Mamma &amp; wishes her a sanctified improvement of all God's
dealings with her, &amp; that it would please him to bring her &amp; all
the family safe to Boston. Jarvis is put up for Cumberland, we hope he
will be there by or before Mayday. This minute I have receiv'd my
queen's night cap from Miss Caty Vans&mdash;we like it. Aunt says, that
if the materials it is made of were more substantial than gauze, it
might serve occationally to hold any thing mesur'd by an 1-2 peck, but
it is just as it should be, &amp; very decent, &amp; she wishes my
writing was <i>as</i> decent. But I got into one of my frolicks, upon
sight of the Cap.</p>


<p>April 1st.&mdash;Will you be offended mamma, if I ask you, if you
remember the flock of wild Geese that papa call'd you to see flying over
the Blacksmith's shop this day three years? I&nbsp;hope not; I&nbsp;only
mean to divert you. The snow is near gone in the street before us, &amp;
mud supplys the place thereof; After a week's absence, I&nbsp;this day
attended Master Holbrook with some difficulty, what was last week a pond
is to-day a quag, thro' which I got safe however, &amp; if aunt<a class

was so bad, she sais she would not have sent me, but I neither wet my
feet, nor drabled my clothes, indeed I have but one garment that I could
contrive to drabble.</p>

<p>April 3.&mdash;Yesterday was the annual Fast, &amp; I was at meeting
all day. Mr Hunt preach'd A.M. from Zac. vii. 4,&nbsp;5, 6,&nbsp;7. He
said, that if we did not mean as we said in pray's it was only a
compliment put upon God, which was a high affront to his divine Majesty.
Mr Bacon, P.M. from James v. 17. He said, "pray's, effectual &amp;
fervent, might be, where there were no words, but there might be elegant
words where there is no prayr's. The essence of pray's consists in
offering up holy desires to God agreeable to his will,&mdash;it is the
flowing out of gracious affections&mdash;what then are the pray'rs of an
unrenewed heart that is full of enmity to God? doubtless they are an
abomination to him. What then, must not unregenerate men pray?
I&nbsp;answer, it is their duty to breathe out holy desires to God in
pray's. Prayer is a natural duty. Hannah pour'd out her soul before the
Lord, yet her voice
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page54" id = "page54"> </a>
<!-- png 081 -->
was not heard, only her lips moved. Some grieve and complain that their
pray's are not answered, but if <i>thy will be done is</i>, as it ought
to be, in every prayer; their prayers are answer'd."</p>

<p>The wind was high at N.E. all day yesterday, but nothing fell from
the dark clouds that overspread the heavens, till 8 o'clock last
evening, when a snow began which has continued falling ever since. The
bell being now ringing for 1 o'clock P.M. &amp; no sign of
abatement.</p>

<p>My aunt Deming says, that if my memory had been equal to the memory
of some of my ancestors, I&nbsp;might have done better justice to Mr.
Bacon's good sermon, &amp; that if hers had been better than mine she
would have helped me. Mr Bacon <i>did</i> say what is here recorded, but
in other method.</p>


<p>April 6.&mdash;I&nbsp;made a shift to walk to meeting yesterday
morning. But there was so much water in the streets when I came home
from meeting that I got a seat in Mr Waleses chaise. My aunt walk'd home
&amp; she sais thro' more difaculty than ever she did in her life
before. Indeed had the stream get
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page55" id = "page55"> </a>
<!-- png 082 -->
up from our meeting house as it did down, we might have taken boat as we
have talk'd some times of doing to cross the street to our oposite
neighbor <i>Soley's</i> chaise. I&nbsp;remember some of Mr Hunts sermon,
how much will appear in my text journal.</p>


<p>April 7.&mdash;I&nbsp;visited yesterday P.M. with my aunt at Mr
Waldron's. This afternoon I am going with my aunt to visit Mrs Salisbury
who is Dr Sewall's granddaughter, I&nbsp;expect Miss Patty Waldow will
meet me there. It is but a little way &amp; we can now thro' favour
cross the street without the help of a boat. I&nbsp;saw Miss Polly Vans
this morning. She gives her love to you. As she always does whenever I
see her. Aunt Deming is this minute come into the room, &amp; from what
her niece has wrote last, takes the liberty to remind you, that Miss
Vans is a sister of the Old South Church, a&nbsp;society remarkable for
Love. Aunt Deming is sorry she has spoil'd the look of this page by her
carelessness &amp; hopes her niece will mend its appearance in what
follows. She wishes my English had been better, but has not time to
correct more than one word.</p>

<p>April 9.&mdash;We made the visit refer'd to above. The company was
old Mrs Salisbury,<a class = "tag" name = "tag60" id = "tag60" href =
"#note60">60</a> Mrs Hill, (Mrs Salisbury's sister she was Miss Hannah
Sewall &amp; is married to young Mr James Hill that us'd to live in this
house) Miss Sally Hill, Miss Polly Belcher Lyde, Miss Caty Sewall, My
Aunt &amp; myself. Yesterday afternoon I visited Miss Polly Deming &amp;
took her with me to Mr Rogers' in the evening where Mr Hunt discours'd
upon the 7<sup>th</sup> question of the catechism viz what are the
decrees of God? I&nbsp;remember a good many of his observations, which I
have got set down on a loose paper. But my aunt says that a Miss of 12
year's old cant possibly do justice to the nicest subject in Divinity,
&amp; therefore had better not attempt a repetition of perticulars, that
she finds lie (as&nbsp;may be easily concluded) somewhat confused in my
young mind. She also says, that in her poor judgment, Mr Hunt discours'd
soundly as well as ingeniously upon the subject, &amp; very much to her
instruction &amp; satisfaction. My Papa inform'd me in his last letter
that he had done me the honor to read my journals &amp; that he
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<a name = "page57" id = "page57"> </a>
<!-- png 084 -->
approv'd of some part of them, I&nbsp;suppose he means that he likes
some parts better than other, indeed it would be wonderful, as aunt
says, if a gentleman of papa's understanding &amp; judgment cou'd be
highly entertain'd with <i>every little</i> saying or observation that
came from a girl of my years &amp; that I ought to esteem it a great
favour that he notices any of my simple matter with his
<i>approbation</i>.</p>


<p>April 13<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;Yesterday I walk'd to meeting all day,
the ground very dry, &amp; when I came home from meeting in the
afternoon the Dust blew so that it almost put my eyes out. What a
difference in the space of a week. I&nbsp;was just going out to writing
school, but a slight rain prevented so aunt says I must make up by
writing well at home. Since I have been writing the rain is turn'd to
snow, which is now falling in a thick shower. I&nbsp;have now before me,
hon<sup>d</sup>. Mamma, your favor dated January 3. I&nbsp;am glad you
alter'd your mind when you at first thought not to write to me.
I&nbsp;am glad my brother made an essay for a Post Script to your
Letter. I&nbsp;must get him to read it to me, when he comes up, for two

<!-- png 085 -->
reasons, the one is because I may have the pleasure of hearing his
voice, the other because I don't understand his characters.
I&nbsp;observe that he is mamma's "Ducky Darling." I&nbsp;never again
shall believe that Mrs Huston will come up to Boston till I see her
here. I&nbsp;shall be very glad to see Mrs Law here &amp; I have some
hopes of it. Mr Gannett and the things you sent by him we safely
receiv'd before I got your Letter&mdash;you say "you see I am still a
great housekeeper," I&nbsp;think more so than when I was with you. Truly
I answer'd Mr Law's letter as soon as I found opportunity therefor.
I&nbsp;shall be very glad to see Miss Jenny here &amp; I wish she could
live with me. I&nbsp;hope you will answer this "viva vosa" as you say
you intend to. Pray mamma who larnt you lattan? It now rains fast, but
the sun shines, &amp; I am glad to see it, because if it continues I am
going abroad with aunt this afternoon.</p>


<p>April 14<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;I&nbsp;went a visiting yesterday to Col.
Gridley's with my aunt. After tea Miss Becky Gridley sung a minuet. Miss
Polly Deming &amp; I danced to her musick,
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page59" id = "page59"> </a>
<!-- png 086 -->
which when perform'd was approv'd of by Mrs Gridley, Mrs Deming, Mrs
Thompson, Mrs Avery,<a class = "tag" name = "tag61" id = "tag61" href =
"#note61">61</a> Miss Sally Hill, Miss Becky Gridley, Miss Polly Gridley
&amp; Miss Sally Winslow. Col<sup>n</sup> Gridley was out o' the room.
Col<sup>n</sup> brought in the talk of Whigs &amp; Tories &amp; taught
me the difference between them. I&nbsp;spent last evening at home.
I&nbsp;should have gone a visiting to day in sudbury street, but Unkle
Harry told me last night that they would be full of company. I&nbsp;had
the pleasure of hearing by him, that they were all well. I&nbsp;believe
I shall go somewhere this afternoon for I have acquaintances enough that
would be very glad to see me, as well as my sudbury street friends.</p>


<p>April 15<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;Yesterday I din'd at Mrs. Whitwell's
&amp; she being going abroad, I&nbsp;spent the afternoon at
Mad<sup>m</sup> Harris's &amp; the evening at home, Unkle Harry gave us
his company some part of it. I&nbsp;am going to Aunt Storer's as soon as
writing school is done. I&nbsp;shall dine with her, if she is not
engaged. It is a long time since I was there, &amp; indeed it is a long
time since I have been able to get there. For tho' the walking has
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page60" id = "page60"> </a>
<!-- png 087 -->
been pretty tolerable at the South End, it has been intolerable down in
town. And indeed till yesterday, it has been such bad walking, that I
could not get there on my feet. If she had wanted much to have seen me,
she might have sent either one of her chaises, her chariot, or her
babyhutt,<a class = "tag" name = "tag62" id = "tag62" href =
"#note62">62</a> one of which I see going by the door almost every
day.</p>


<p>April 16<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;I&nbsp;dined with Aunt Storer yesterday
&amp; spent the afternoon very agreeably at Aunt Suky's. Aunt Storer is
not very well, but she drank tea with us, &amp; went down to Mr
Stillman's lecture in the evening. I&nbsp;spent the evening with Unkle
&amp; Aunt at Mrs Rogers's. Mr Bacon preach'd his fourth sermon from
Romans iv. 6.&nbsp;My cousin Charles Storer lent me Gulliver's Travels
abreviated, which aunt says I may read for the sake of perfecting myself
in reading a variety of composures. she sais farther that the piece was
desin'd as a burlesque upon the times in which it was wrote,&mdash;&amp;
Martimas Scriblensis &amp; Pope Dunciad were wrote with the same design
&amp; as parts of the same work, tho' wrote by three several hands.</p>

<p>April 17<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;You see, Mamma, I&nbsp;comply with your
orders (or&nbsp;at least have done father's some time past) of writing
in my journal every day tho' my matters are of little importance &amp; I
have nothing at present to communicate except that I spent yesterday
afternoon &amp; evening at Mr Soley's. The day was very rainy.
I&nbsp;hope I shall at least learn to spell the word <i>yesterday</i>,
it having occur'd so frequently in these pages! (The bell is ringing for
good friday.) Last evening aunt had a letter from Unkle Pierce, he
informs her, that last Lords day morning Mrs Martin was deliver'd of a
daughter. She had been siezed the Monday before with a violent pluritick
fever, which continued when my Unkle's letter was dated 13<sup>th</sup>
instant. My Aunt Deming is affraid that poor Mrs Martin is no more. She
hopes she is reconcil'd to her father&mdash;but is affraid whether that
was so&mdash;She had try'd what was to be done that way on her late
visits to Portsmouth, &amp; found my unkle was placably dispos'd, poor
Mrs Martin, she could not then be brought to make any acknowledgements
as she ought to have done.</p>

<p>April 18<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;Some time since I exchang'd a piece of
patchwork, which had been wrought in my leisure intervals, with Miss
Peggy Phillips,<a class = "tag" name = "tag63" id = "tag63" href =
"#note63">63</a> my schoolmate, for a pair of curious lace mitts with
blue flaps which I shall send, with a yard of white ribbin edg'd with
green to Miss Nancy Macky for a present. I&nbsp;had intended that the
patchwork should have grown large enough to have cover'd a bed when that
same live stock which you wrote me about some time since, should be
increas'd to that portion you intend to bestow upon me, should a certain
event take place. I&nbsp;have just now finish'd my Letter to Papa.
I&nbsp;had wrote to my other correspondents at Cumberland, some time
ago, all which with this I wish safe to your &amp; their hand.
I&nbsp;have been carefull not to repeat in my journal any thing that I
had wrote in a Letter either to papa, you, &amp;c. Else I should have
inform'd you of some of Bet Smith's abominations with the deserv'd
punishment she is soon to meet with. But I have wrote it to papa, so
need not repeat. I&nbsp;guess when this reaches you, you will be too
much engag'd in preparing to quit your
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<a name = "page63" id = "page63"> </a>
<!-- png 090 -->
present habitation, &amp; will have too much upon your head &amp; hands,
to pay much attention to this scrowl. But it may be an amusement to you
on your voyage&mdash;therefore I send&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Pray mamma, be so kind as to bring up all my journal with you. My
Papa has promised me, he will bring up my baby house with him.
I&nbsp;shall send you a droll figure of a young lady,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag64" id = "tag64" href = "#note64">64</a> in or under, which
you please, a&nbsp;tasty head Dress. It was taken from a print that came
over in one of the last ships from London. After you have sufficiently
amused yourself with it I am willing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>


<p>Boston April 20, 1772.&mdash;Last Saterday I seal'd up 45 pages of
Journal for Cumberland. This is a very stormy day&mdash;no going to
school. I&nbsp;am learning to knit lace.</p>

funerals from their window, poor Cap<sup>n</sup> Turner's was one.</p>


<p>April 22<sup>d</sup>.&mdash;I&nbsp;spent this evening at Miss Rogers
as usual. Mr. Hunt continued his discourse upon the 7<sup>th</sup>

upon&nbsp;it.</p>

told the Church that brother Hunt would supply the pulpit till his
return. I&nbsp;made a visit this afternoon with cousin Sally at Dr.
Phillip's.</p>


<p>April 24<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;I&nbsp;drank tea at Aunt Suky's. Aunt
Storer was there, she seemed to be in charming good health &amp;
spirits. My cousin Charles Green seems to grow a little fat pritty boy
but he is very light. My aunt Storer lent me 3 of cousin Charles' books
to read, viz.&mdash;The puzzeling cap, the female Oraters &amp; the
history of Gaffer too-shoes.<a class = "tag" name = "tag65" id = "tag65"

with my friends at Marshfield, &amp; returned on saterday last in good
health &amp; gay spirits which I still enjoy. The 2 first days I was at
Marshfield, the heat was extream &amp; uncommon for the season. It ended
on saterday evening with a great thunder storm. The air has been very
cool ever since. My aunt Deming observ'd a great deal of lightning in
the south, but there was neither thunder, rain nor clouds in Boston.</p>


<p>May 16.&mdash;Last Wednesday Bet Smith was set upon the gallows. She

Handcock invited the whole company into his house in the afternoon &amp;
treated them very genteelly &amp; generously, with cake, wine, &amp;c.
There were 10 corn baskets of the feast (at&nbsp;the Hall) sent to the

Green's, over the way, yesterday towards evening, I&nbsp;took a walk
with cousin Sally to see the good folks in Sudbury Street, &amp; found
them all well. I&nbsp;had my HEDDUS roll on, aunt Storer said it ought
to be made less, Aunt Deming said it ought not to be made at all. It
makes my head itch, &amp; ach, &amp; burn like anything Mamma. This
famous roll is not made <i>wholly</i> of a red <i>Cow Tail</i>, but is a
mixture of that, &amp; horsehair (very course) &amp; a little human hair
of yellow hue, that I suppose was taken out of the back part of an old
wig. But D&mdash;&mdash; made it (our head) all carded together and
twisted up. When it first came home, aunt put it on, &amp; my new cap on
it, she then took up her apron &amp; mesur'd me, &amp; from the roots of
my hair on my forehead to the top of my notions, I&nbsp;mesur'd above an
inch longer than I did downwards from the roots of my hair to the end of
my chin. Nothing renders a young person more amiable than virtue &amp;

<p>31<sup>st</sup> May.&mdash;Monday last I was at the factory to see a
piece of cloth cousin Sally spun for a summer coat for unkle. After
viewing the work we recollected the room we sat down in was Libberty
Assembly Hall, otherwise called factory hall, so Miss Gridley &amp; I
did ourselves the Honour of dancing a minuet in it. On tuesday I made
Mrs Smith my morning &amp; p.m. visits as usual, neither Mr. Holbrook
nor Turner have any school this week, nor till tuesday next.
I&nbsp;spent yesterday with my friends in sudbury St. Cousin Frank has
got a fever, aunt Storer took an emmetick while I was there, cousin
Betsy had violent pains almost all the forenoon. Last tuesday Miss
Ursula Griswold, daughter of the right Hon. Matthew Griswold Esq
governer of one of his Majesty's provinces, was made one of our family,
&amp; I have the honor of being her chambermade. I&nbsp;have just been
reading over what I wrote to the company present, &amp; have got myself

<p>31 May.&mdash;I&nbsp;spent the afternoon at unkle Joshua's.
yesterday, after tea I went to see how aunt Storer did. I&nbsp;found her
well at Unkle Frank's. Mr Gerrish &amp; wife of Halifax I had the
pleasure to meet there, the latter sends love to you. Indeed Mamma, till
I receiv'd your last favour, I&nbsp;never heard a word about the little
basket &amp;c. which I sent to brother Johny last fall. I&nbsp;suppose
Harry had so much to write about cotton, that he forgot what was of more
consequence. Dear Mamma, what name has Mr Bent given his Son? something
like Nehemiah, or Jehoshaphat, I&nbsp;suppose, it must be an odd name
(our head indeed, Mamma.) Aunt says she hopes it a'nt Baal Gad, &amp;
she also says that I am a little simpleton for making my note within the
brackets above, because, when I omit to do it, Mamma will think I have
the help of somebody else's head but, N.B. for herself she utterly
disclames having either her head or hand concern'd in this curious
journal, except where the writing makes it manifest. So much for this
matter.</p>

<p>Aunt Deming was Sarah, the oldest child of John Winslow and Sarah
Peirce, and therefore sister of Joshua Winslow, Anna Green Winslow's
father. She was born August 2, 1722, died March 10, 1788. She married
John West, and after his death married, on February 27, 1752, John
Deming. He was a respectable and intelligent Boston citizen, but not a
wealthy man. He was an ensign in the Ancient and Honorable Artillery in
1771, and a deacon of the Old South Church in 1769, both of which
offices were patents of nobility in provincial Boston. They lived in
Central Court, leading out of Washington Street, just south of Summer
Street. Aunt Deming eked out a limited income in a manner dear to Boston
gentlewomen in those and in later days; she took young ladies to board
while they attended Boston schools. Advertisements in colonial
newspapers of "Board and half-board for young ladies" were not rare, and
many good old New England names are seen in these advertisements. Aunt
Deming was a woman of much judgment, as is shown in the pages of this
diary; of much power of graphic description, as is
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<a name = "page76" id = "page76"> </a>
<!-- png 104 -->
proved by a short journal written for her niece, Sally Coverly, and
letters of hers which are still preserved. She died childless.</p>

<p>Cumberland was the home in Nova Scotia of Anna Green Winslow's
parents, where her father held the position of commissary to the British
regiments stationed there. George Green, Anna's uncle, writing to Joseph
Green, at Paramaribo, on July 23, 1770, said: "Mr. Winslow &amp; wife
still remain at Cumberland, have one son &amp; one daughter, the last
now at Boston for schooling, &amp;c." So, at the date of the first entry
in the diary, Anna had been in Boston probably about a year and a
half.</p>


<p class = "notehead">
<a name = "note3" id = "note3" href = "#tag3">Note 3.</a></p>

<p>Anna Green Winslow had doubtless heard much talk about this Rev. John
Bacon, the new minister at the Old South Church, for much had been said
about him in the weekly press: whether he should have an ordination
dinner or not, and he did not; accounts of his ordination; and then
notice of the sale of his sermons in the <i>Boston Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>All Mr. Bacon's parishioners did not share Anna's liking for him; he
found himself at the Old South in sorely troubled waters. He made a most
unpropitious and trying entrance at best, through succeeding the beloved
Joseph Sewall, who had preached to Old South listeners for fifty-six
years. He came to town a stranger. When, a&nbsp;month later, Governor
Hutchinson
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77" id = "page77"> </a>
<!-- png 105 -->
issued his annual Thanksgiving Proclamation, there was placed therein an
"exceptionable clause" that was very offensive to Boston patriots,
relating to the continuance of civil and religious liberties. It had
always been the custom to have the Proclamation read by the ministers in
the Boston churches for the two Sundays previous to Thanksgiving Day,
but the ruling governor very cannily managed to get two Boston clergymen
to read his proclamation the third Sunday before the appointed day, when
all the church members, being unsuspectingly present, had to listen to
the unwelcome words. One of these clerical instruments of gubernatorial
diplomacy and craft was John Bacon. Samuel Adams wrote bitterly of him,
saying, "He performed this servile task a week before the time, when the
people were not aware of it." The <i>Boston Gazette</i> of November 11
commented severely on Mr. Bacon's action, and many of his congregation
were disgusted with him, and remained after the service to talk the
Proclamation and their unfortunate new minister over.</p>

<p>It might have been offered, one might think, as some excuse, that he
had so recently come from Maryland, and was probably unacquainted with
the intenseness of Massachusetts politics; and that he had also been a
somewhat busy and preoccupied man during his six weeks' presence in
Boston, for he had been marrying a wife,&mdash;or rather a widow. In the
<i>Boston Evening Post</i> of November 11, 1771, I&nbsp;read this
notice: "Married, the Rev'd John Bacon to Mrs. Elizabeth Cummings,
daughter of Ezekiel Goldthwait, Esq."</p>

<span class = "pagenum">78</span>

<p>He retained his pastorate, however, in spite of his early mistake,
through anxious tea-party excitement and forlorn war-threatened days,
till 1775, with but scant popularity and slight happiness, with bitter
differences of opinion with his people over atonement and imputation,
and that ever-present stumbling-block to New England
divines,&mdash;baptism under the Half Covenant,&mdash;till he was asked
to resign.</p>

<p>Nor did he get on over smoothly with his fellow minister, John Hunt.
In a curious poem of the day, called "Boston Ministers" (which is
reprinted in the <i>New England Historical and Genealogical Register</i>
of April, 1859), these verses appear:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "poem pair">
At Old South there's a jarring pair,<br>
If I am not mistaken,</p>
<p class = "poem pair">
One may descry with half an eye<br>
That Hunt is far from Bacon.</p>
<p class = "poem pair">
Wise Hunt can trace out means of grace<br>
As leading to conversion,</p>
<p class = "poem pair">
But Hopkins scheme is Bacons theme,<br>
And strange is his assertion.</p>

<p>It mattered little, however, that Parson Bacon had to leave the Old
South, for that was soon no longer a church, but a riding school for the
British troops.</p>

<p>Mr. Bacon retired, after his dismissal, to Canterbury, Conn., his
birthplace. His friendly intimacy with Mrs. Deming proved of value to
her, for when she left Boston, in April, 1775, at the time of the
closing of the city gates, she met Mr. Bacon in Providence. She says in
her journal:&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<a name = "page79" id = "page79"> </a>
<!-- png 107 -->

<p>"Towards evening Mr &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Bacon, with their daughter,
came into town. M<sup>r</sup> Bacon came to see me. Enquir'd into my
designs, &amp;c. I&nbsp;told him truely I did not know what to do. That
I had thot of giting farther into the country. Of trying to place Sally
in some family where she might earn her board, &amp; to do something
like it for Lucinda, or put her out upon wages. That when I left the
plain I had some faint hope I might hear from Mr Deming while I
continued at Providence, but that I had little of that hope remaining.
M<sup>r</sup> Bacon advised me to go into Connecticutt, the very thing I
was desirous of. Mr Bacon sd that he would advise me for the present to
go to Canterbury, his native place. That he would give me a Letter to
his Sister, who would receive me kindly &amp; treat me tenderly, &amp;
that he would follow me there in a few days."</p>

<p>This advice Mrs. Deming took, and made Canterbury her temporary
home.</p>

<p>Mr. Bacon did not again take charge of a parish. After the Revolution
he became a magistrate, went to the legislature, became judge of the
court of common pleas, and a member of congress. He did not wholly give
up his disputatious ways, if we can judge from the books written by and
to him, one of the latter being, "A&nbsp;Droll, a&nbsp;Deist, and a John
Bacon, Master of Arts, Gently Reprimanded."</p>

<p>His wife, who was born in 1733, and died in Stockbridge in 1821, was
the daughter of Ezekiel Goldthwait, a&nbsp;Tory citizen of Boston,
a&nbsp;register of deeds, and a wealthy merchant. A&nbsp;portrait of
Mrs. Bacon,

<p>Rev. John Hunt was born in Northampton, November 20, 1744. He was a
Harvard graduate in the class of 1764, a&nbsp;classmate of Caleb Strong
and John Scollay. He was installed colleague-pastor of the Old South
Church with John Bacon in 1771. He found it a most trying position. He
was of an amiable and gentle disposition, and the poem on "Boston
Ministers" asserted that he "most friends with sisters made." Another
Boston rhymester called him "puny John from Northampton,
a&nbsp;meek-mouth moderate man." When the gates of Boston were closed in
1775, after the battle of Lexington, he returned to Northampton, and
died there of consumption, December 20, 1775. A&nbsp;full account of his
life is given in <i>Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit</i>. See

<p>"Unkle and Aunt Winslow" were Mr. and Mrs. John Winslow. He was the
brother of Joshua Winslow, was born March, 1725-26, died September 29,
1773, in Boston. He was married, on March 12, 1752, to Elizabeth Mason
(born September, 1723, died January, 1780). They had five children:
I.&nbsp;Gen. John Winslow, born September 26, 1753, married Ann Gardner,
May 21, 1782, died November 29, 1819. II.&nbsp;Sarah, born April 12,

died October 13, 1766. IV.&nbsp;Elizabeth, born November 28, 1759, died
September 8, 1760. V.&nbsp;Elizabeth, born September 14, 1760, married
John Holland, died November 21, 1795.</p>

<p>Gen. John Winslow was the favorite nephew of Joshua Winslow and of
his wife, and largely inherited their property. He remained in Boston
through the siege, and preserved the communion plate of the Old South
Church by burying it in his uncle Mason's cellar. He was an ardent
patriot, and it is said that his uncle Joshua threatened to hang him if
he caught him during the Revolutionary War. The nephew answered, "No
catchee&mdash;no hangee, Uncle;" but did have the contrary fortune of
capturing the uncle, whom he released on parole. He was the sixth signer
and first treasurer of the Society of the Cincinnati. General Winslow's
daughter, Mary Ann Winslow, born in 1790, lived till 1882, and from her
were obtained many of the facts given in these notes.</p>

friends of the Winslows and Demings. William Whitwell was born September

and useful citizen, and church member. His first wife was Rebecca
Keayne, his second Elizabeth Scott (or&nbsp;Swett), who died May 13,
1771; his third, the widow of Royal Tyler. The Mrs. Whitwell here
referred to must have been Mrs. Samuel Whitwell, for William Whitwell
just at that interval was a widower. Samuel Whitwell was born December
17, <span class = "smallroman">O.S.</span> 1717, died June 8, 1801. His

1755, died April 3, 1804. She married, November 27, 1787, Samuel
Coverly, deacon of the Old South Church. She was the Sally Coverly for
whom Mrs. Deming's journal was written. Several of Sally Coverly's
letters still exist, and are models of elegant penmanship and correct
spelling, and redound to the credit of her writing teacher, Master
Holbrook. All the d's and y's and t's end with elaborately twisted
little curls. A&nbsp;careful margin of an inch is left on every side.
The letters speak so plainly of the formal honor and respect paid by all
well-bred persons of the day to their elders, even though familiar
kinsfolk, that I quote one, which contains much family news:&mdash;</p>

<p>Josiah Waters, Jr., was the son of Josiah and Abigail Dawes Waters.
The latter lived to be ninety-five years old. Josiah Sr. was a captain
in the Artillery Company in 1769, and Josiah Jr. in 1791. The latter
married, on March 14, 1771, Mary, daughter of William and Elizabeth
Whitwell. See <a href = "#note7">Note 7</a>. Their child, Josiah Waters,
tertius, born December 29, 1771, lived till August 4, 1818. He was a
Latin School boy, and in the class with Josiah Quincy at Harvard.</p>

<p>The life of this slave-girl Lucinda was a fair example of the gentle
form of slavery which existed till this century in our New England
States. From an old paper written by a daughter of Gen. John Winslow,
I&nbsp;quote her description of this girl:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lucinda was born in Africa and purchased by M<sup>rs</sup> Deming
when she was about seven years of age. She was cherished with care and
affection by the family, and at Mrs. Demings death was 'given her
freedom.' From that time she chose to make her home with 'Master John'
(the late Gen. John Winslow, of Boston), a&nbsp;nephew of M<sup>rs</sup>
Demings&mdash;at his house she died after some years. The friends
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<a name = "page87" id = "page87"> </a>
<!-- png 115 -->
of the Winslow family attended her funeral; her pastor the Rev
D<sup>r</sup> Eckley of the Old South and Gen. W.&nbsp;walking next the
hearse as chief mourners. A&nbsp;few articles belonging to her are
preserved in the family as memorials of one who was a beloved member of
the household in the olden time."</p>

<p>Lucinda figures in Mrs. Deming's account of her escape from besieged
Boston in 1775, and was treated with as much consideration as was Sally,
the niece; for her mistress remained behind for a time at Wrentham;
rather than to allow Lucinda to ride outside the coach in the rain.</p>

<p>In a letter written by Sally Coverly, August 6, 1795, to Mrs. Joshua
Winslow, at Quebec, she says: "You enquire about Lucinda, she is very
much gratified by it. She has lived with my Brother this ten years and
is very good help in their family."</p>

<p>The "Miss Sheafs" were Nancy and Mary Sheaffe, youngest daughters of
William Sheaffe, who had recently died, leaving a family of four sons
and six daughters. He had been deputy collector of customs under Joseph
Harrison, the last royal collector of the port. He left his family
penniless, and a small shop was stocked by friends for Mrs Sheaffe.
I&nbsp;have often seen her advertisements in Boston newspapers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheaffe was Susanna Child, daughter of Thomas Child, an
Englishman, one of the founders of Trinity Church. She lived till 1811.
The ten children grew up to fill dignified positions in life.

One son was Sir Roger Hale Sheaffe. Susanna, at the age of fifteen, made
a most romantic runaway match with an English officer, Capt. Ponsonby
Molesworth. Margaret married John R. Livingstone; she was a great
beauty. Lafayette, on his return to France, sent her a satin cardinal
lined with ermine, and an elegant gown. Helen married James Lovell. (See
<a href = "#note52">Note 52</a>.) Nancy, or Anne Sheaffe, married, in
September, 1786, John Erving, Jr., a&nbsp;nephew of Governor Shirley,
and died young, leaving three children,&mdash;Maria, Frances, and Major
John Erving. Mary married Benj. Cutler, high sheriff of Boston, and died
December 8, 1784, leaving no children. These Sheaffes were nearly all
buried in the Child tomb in Trinity Church.</p>

<p>Governor Matthew Griswold was born March 25, 1714, died April 28,
1799. He married, on Nov. 10, 1743, his second cousin, Ursula Wolcott,
daughter of Gov. Roger Wolcott. A&nbsp;very amusing story is told of
their courtship. Governor Griswold in early life wished to marry a young
lady in Durham, Conn. She was in love with a physician, whom she hoped
would propose to her, and in the mean time was unwilling to give up her
hold upon her assured lover. At last the governor, tired of being held
in an uncertainty, pressed her for a definite answer. She pleaded that
she wished for more time, when he rose with dignity and answered her,
"I&nbsp;will give you a lifetime." This experience made him extremely
shy,
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page89" id = "page89"> </a>
<!-- png 117 -->
and when thrown with his cousin Ursula he made no advance towards
love-making. At last when she was nineteen and he ten years older she
began asking him on every occasion, "What did you say, Cousin Matthew?"
and he would answer her quietly, "Nothing." At last she asked him
impatiently, "What did you say, Cousin Matthew?" and when he answered
again "Nothing," she replied sharply, "Well, it's time you
did,"&mdash;and <i>he did</i>.</p>

<p>Their daughter Ursula, the visitor at Mrs. Deming's, was born April
13, 1754, and was a great beauty. She married, in November 22, 1777, her
third cousin, Lynde McCurdy, of Norwich, Conn.</p>

<p>"Unkle Joshua" was Joshua Green, born in Boston, May 17, 1731,
"Monday 1/2 past 9 oclock in the morn<sup>g</sup>" and died in Wendell,
Mass., on September 2, 1811. He attended the Boston Latin School in
1738, and was in the class of 1749 at Harvard. He married, as did his
brother and sister, a&nbsp;Storer&mdash;Hannah, daughter of Ebenezer and
Mary Edwards Storer&mdash;on October 7, 1762. After his marriage he
lived in Court Street, the third house south of Hanover Street. His wife
Hannah was for many years before and after her marriage&mdash;as was her
mother&mdash;the intimate friend and correspondent of Abigail Adams,
wife of John Adams. Some of their letters may be found in the <i>Account
of Percival and Ellen Green and Some of their Descendants</i>, written
by Hon. Samuel Abbott Green, who is a great-grandson of Joshua and
Hannah Green.</p>

<p>Miss Caty Vans was the granddaughter of Hugh Vans, a&nbsp;merchant of
Boston, who became a member of the Old South Church in 1728. He was born
in Ayr, Scotland, in 1699. He married Mary Pemberton, daughter of Rev.
Ebenezer Pemberton, and died in Boston in 1763. They had four sons,
John, Ebenezer, Samuel, and William. One of the first three was the
father of Caty Vans, who was born January 18, 1770. There are frequent
references to her throughout the diary, but I know nothing of her life.
William Vans married Mary Clarke, of Salem, and had one son, William,
and one daughter, Rebecca, who married Captain Jonathan Carnes. The Vans
family Bible is in the library of the Essex Institute.</p>

<p>"Aunt Sukey" was Susanna Green, born July 26, 1744, died November 10,
1775. She married, on October 18, 1769, her cousin, Francis Green. The
little child Charles, of whom Anna writes, proved to be a deaf-mute, and
was drowned near Halifax in 1787. Francis Green had two deaf-mute
children by a second wife, and became prominent afterwards in
Massachusetts for his interest in and promotion of methods in
instructing the deaf. In a letter of George Green's, dated Boston, July
23, 1770, we read: "Frank Green was married to Sukey in October last and
they live next house to Mrs Storers." From another, dated December 5,
1770: "Frank keeps a ship going between here &amp; London, but I believe
understands little of the matter, having never been bred to business wch
was one great objection with my father to his courting Sukey."
I&nbsp;think he must have developed into a capable business man, for I
have frequently seen his business advertisements in Boston newspapers of
his day. Anna's mother bequeathed seven hundred and fifty dollars to
Francis Green in her will. He was a man universally esteemed in the
community.</p>

<p>Master Holbrook was Samuel Holbrook, Anna's writing-master, one of a
highly honored family of Boston writing teachers. Perhaps the best known
of this family was Abiah Holbrook. In the <i>Boston Gazette</i> of
January 30, 1769, I&nbsp;find this notice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last Friday morning died Mr Abiah Holbrook in the 51st year of his
Age, Master of the South Writing School in this Town. He was looked upon
by the Best Judges as the Greatest Master of the Pen we have ever had
among us, of which he has left a most beautiful Demonstration. He was
indefatigable in his labours, successful in his Instructions, an Honour
to the Town and to crown all an Ornament to the Religion of Jesus. His
Funeral is to be Attended Tomorrow Afternoon at Four Oclock."</p>

<p>The "beautiful Demonstration" of his penmanship which he left behind
him was a most intricate piece of what was known as "fine knotting" or
"knot work." It was written in "all the known hands of Great Britain."
This work occupied every moment of what Abiah Holbrook called his "spare
time" for seven years. It was valued at £100. It was bequeathed to
Harvard College, unless his wife should need the money which could be
obtained from selling it. If this were so, she was to offer it first for
purchase to John Hancock. Abiah was a stanch patriot.</p>

<p>Samuel Holbrook was a brother of Abiah. He began teaching in 1745,
when about eighteen years old. A&nbsp;petition of Abiah, dated March 10,
1745-46, sets forth that his school had two hundred and twenty
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<a name = "page93" id = "page93"> </a>
<!-- png 121 -->
scholars (Well may his funeral notice say that he was indefatigable in
his labors!), that finding it impossible to properly instruct such a
great number, he had appointed his brother to teach part of them and had
paid his board for seven months, else some of the scholars must have
been turned off without any instruction. He therefore prayed the town to
grant him assistance. Think of one master for such a great school! In
1750 Samuel Holbrook's salary as usher of the South Writing School was
fifty pounds per annum.</p>

<p>After serving as writing-master of the school in Queen Street, and
also keeping a private school, he was chosen master of the South Writing
School in March, 1769, to supply the place of his brother Abiah
deceased. His salary was one hundred pounds. In 1776, and again in 1777,
he received eighty pounds in addition to his salary. He also was a
patriot. He was one of the "Sons of Liberty" who dined at the Liberty
Tree, Dorchester, on August 14, 1769; and he was a member of Captain
John Haskin's company in 1773. He was a member of the Old South Church,
and he died July 24, 1784. In his later years he kept a school at West
Street, where afterwards was Amos Lawrence's garden.</p>

<p>Abiah and Samuel left behind them better demonstrations of their
capacity than pieces of "knot-work"&mdash;in the handwriting of their
scholars. They taught what Jonathan Snelling described as "Boston Style
of Wri<sup>ting</sup>," and loudly do the elegant letters and signatures
of their scholars, Boston patriots,
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>

<!-- png 122 -->
clergy, and statesmen, redound to the credit of the Masters
Holbrook.</p>

<p>Other Holbrooks taught in Boston. From the Selectmen's Minutes of
that little town, we find that on November 10, 1773,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr Holbrook, Master of the Writing School in the Common, and Mr
Carter the Master Elect of the school in Queen St having recommended Mr
Abiah Holbrook, a&nbsp;young man near of age, as a suitable person to be
usher at Mr Carters school&mdash;the Selectmen sent for him, and upon
discoursing with the young man thought proper to appoint him usher of
said school."</p>

<p>And from the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, of April 17, 1769, we learn that
Mr. Joseph Ward "Opened an English Grammar School in King St where Mr
Joseph Holbrook hath for many years kept a Writing School."</p>

<p>These entries of Anna's relating to her attending Master Holbrook's
school have an additional value in that they prove that both boys and
girls attended these public writing schools,&mdash;a&nbsp;fact which has
been disputed.</p>

<p>Dr. James Lloyd, born March 14, 1728, died March 14, 1810. He began
his medical practice in 1752. He was appointed surgeon of the garrison
at Boston, and was a close friend of Sir William Howe and Earl Percy,
who for a time lived in his house. He was an Episcopalian, and one of
the indignant protesters against the alteration of the liturgy at King's
Chapel. Though a warm Tory and Loyalist,
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<a name = "page95" id = "page95"> </a>

he was never molested by the American government. He was one of Boston's
most skilful and popular physicians for many years. While other city
doctors got but a shilling and sixpence for their regular fee, he
charged and received the exorbitant sum of half a dollar a visit; and
for "bringing little master to town," in which function he was a
specialist, he charged a guinea.</p>

<p>A pincushion was for many years, and indeed is still, in some parts
of New England, a&nbsp;highly conventional gift to a mother with a young
babe. Mrs. Deming must have made many of these cushions. One of her
manufacture still exists. It is about five inches long and three inches
wide; one side is of white silk stuck around the edge with old-fashioned
clumsy pins, with the words, "John Winslow March 1783. Welcome Little
Stranger." The other side is of gray satin with green spots, with a
cluster of pins in the centre, and other pins winding around in a vine
and forming a row round the edge.</p>

<p>Though the exchange of Christmas gifts was rare in New England,
a&nbsp;certain observance of New Year's Day by gifts seems to have
obtained. And we find in Judge Sewall's diary that he was greeted on New
Year's morn with a levet, or blast of trumpets, under his window; and he
celebrated the opening of the eighteenth century with a very poor poem
of his own
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>

composition, which he caused to be recited through Boston streets by the

read of pompedore shoes, laces, capes, aprons, sacques, stockings, and
head-dresses.</p>

<p>Aunt Storer was Mrs. Ebenezer Storer. Her maiden name was Elizabeth
Green. She was a sister of Mrs. Joshua Winslow. She was born October 12,
1734, died December 8, 1774; was married July 17, 1751, to Ebenezer
Storer, who was born January 27, 1729-30, died January 6, 1807. He was a
Harvard graduate, and was for many years treasurer of that college. He
was one of Boston's most intellectual and respected citizens. His
library was large. His name constantly appears on the lists of
subscribers to new books. After his death his astronomical instruments
became the property of Harvard College, and as late as 1843 his
comet-finder was used there.</p>

<p>As Anna Green Winslow spent so much of her time in her "Aunt Storers"
home in Sudbury Street, it is interesting to know that a very correct
picture of this elegant Boston home of colonial days has been preserved
through the account given in the <i>Memoir of Eliza Susan Morton
Quincy</i>,&mdash;though many persons still living remember the
house:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The mansion of Ebenezer Storer, an extensive
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<a name = "page97" id = "page97"> </a>
<!-- png 125 -->
edifice of wood three stories in height, was erected in 1700. It was
situated on Sudbury Street between two trees of great size and
antiquity. An old English elm of uncommon height and circumference grew
in the sidewalk of the street before the mansion, and behind it was a
sycamore tree of almost equal age and dimensions. It fronted to the
south with one end toward the street. From the gate a broad walk of red
sandstone separated it from a grass-plot which formed the courtyard, and
passed the front door to the office of Mr. Storer. The vestibule of the
house, from which a staircase ascended, opened on either side into the
dining and drawing rooms. Both had windows towards the courtyard and
also opened by glazed doors into a garden behind the house. They were
long low apartments; the walls wainscoted and panelled; the furniture of
carved mahogany. The ceilings were traversed through the length of the
rooms by a large beam cased and finished like the walls; and from the
centre of each depended a glass globe which reflected as in a convex
mirror all surrounding objects. There was a rich Persian carpet in the
drawing-room, the colors crimson and green. The curtains and the
cushions of the window-seat were of green damask; and oval mirrors and
girandoles and a teaset of rich china completed the furniture of that
apartment. The wide chimney-place in the dining room was lined and
ornamented with Dutch tiles; and on each side stood capacious armchairs
cushioned and covered with green damask, for the master and mistress of
the family. On the walls
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
<a name = "page98" id = "page98"> </a>
<!-- png 126 -->
were portraits in crayon by Copley, and valuable engravings representing
Franklin with his lightning rod, Washington, and other eminent men of
the last century. Between the windows hung a long mirror in a mahogany
frame; and opposite the fireplace was a buffet ornamented with porcelain
statuettes and a set of rich china. A&nbsp;large apartment in the second
story was devoted to a valuable library, a&nbsp;philosophical apparatus,
a&nbsp;collection of engravings, a&nbsp;solar microscope, a&nbsp;camera,
etc."</p>

<p>As I read this description I seem to see the figure of our happy
little diary-writer reflected in the great glass globes that hung from
the summer-trees, while she danced on the Persian carpet, or sat curled
up reading on the cushioned window-seat.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles Chauncey was born January 1, 1705; died February 10,

First Church in Boston. He was an equally active opponent of Whitefield
and of Episcopacy. He was an ardent and romantic patriot, yet so plain
in his ways and views that he wished <i>Paradise Lost</i> might be
turned into prose that he might understand&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Rev. Ebenezer Pemberton was pastor of the New Brick Church. He had a
congregation of stanch Whigs; but unluckily, the Tory Governor
Hutchinson also attended his church. Dr. Pemberton was the other
minister of the two who sprung the Governor's hated Thanksgiving
proclamation of 1771 on their parishes a week ahead of time, as told in
<a href = "#note3">Note 3</a>, and the astounded and disgusted New Brick
hearers, more violent than the Old South attendants, walked out of
meeting while it was being read. Dr. Pemberton's troubled and unhappy
pastorate came to an end by the closing of his church in war times in
1775. He was of the 1721 class of Harvard College. He died September 9,
1777.</p>

<p>We find frequent references in the writings and newspapers of the
times to this truly Puritanical dread of bishops. To the descendants of
the Pilgrims the very name smacked of incense, stole, and monkish
jargon. A&nbsp;writer, signing himself "America," gives in the <i>Boston
Evening Post</i>, of October 14, 1771, a&nbsp;communication thoroughly
characteristic of the spirit of the community against the establishment
of bishops, the persistent determination to "beate down every sprout of
episcopacie."</p>

spite of its name, was not only in high fashion for many years, but was
worn for full dress. Abigail Adams, writing to Mrs. Storer, on January
20, 1785, says: "Trimming is reserved for full dress only, when very
large hoops and negligées with trains three yards long are worn."
I&nbsp;find advertised in the <i>Boston Evening Post</i>, as early as

<p>There exists in New England a tradition of "groaning cake," made and
baked in honor of a mother and babe. These cakes which Anna bought of
the nurse may have been "groaning cakes." It was always customary at
that time to give "vails" to the nurse when visiting a new-born child;
sometimes gifts of money, often of trinkets and articles of
clothing.</p>

married Rev. Thomas Prentiss on February 9, 1798, had nine children, and
lived to be eighty-two years old&mdash;dying in 1841. Her sister Mercy
was engaged to be married to General Warren, but he fell at Bunker Hill:
and his betrothed devoted herself afterwards to the care and education
of his orphaned children whom he had by his first wife.</p>

Quincy (who was born 1710, died 1784), and his third wife, Ann Marsh.
Ann was born December 8, 1763, and thus would have been in her ninth
year at the time of the little rout. She married the Rev. Asa Packard,
of Marlborough, Mass., in 1790.</p>

<p>In the universal use of wines and strong liquors in New England at
that date children took unrestrainedly their proportionate part. It
seems strange to think of this girl assembly of little Bostonians
drinking wine and hot or cold punch as part of their

"treat," yet no doubt they were well accustomed to such fare.
I&nbsp;know of a little girl of still tenderer years who was sent at
that same time from the Barbadoes to her grandmother's house in Boston
to be "finished" in Boston schools, as was Anna, and who left her
relative's abode in high dudgeon because she was not permitted to have
wine at her meals; and her parents upheld her, saying Missy must be
treated like a lady and have all the wine she wished. Cobbett, who
thought liquor drinking the national disease of America, said that "at
all hours of the day little boys at or under twelve years of age go into
stores and tip off their drams." Thus it does not seem strange for
little maids also to drink at a party. The temperance awakening of this
century came none too soon.</p>

<p>Paste ornaments were universally worn by both men and women, as well
as by little girls, and formed the decoration of much of the headgear of
fashionable dames. Many advertisements appear in New England newspapers,
which show how large and varied was the importation of hair ornaments at
that date. We find advertised in the <i>Boston Evening Post</i>, of
1768: "Double and single row knotted Paste Combs, Paste Hair Sprigs
&amp; Pins all prices. Marcasite and Pearl Hair Sprigs, Garnet &amp;
Pearl Hair Sprigs." In the <i>Salem Gazette</i> and various Boston
papers I read of "black &amp; coloured plumes &amp; feathers." Other
hair ornaments advertised in the
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>

<i>Boston News Letter</i>, of December, 1768, were "Long and small Tail
Garnets, Mock Garland of all sorts and Ladies Poll Combs." Steel plumes,
pompons, aigrettes, and rosettes all were worn on the head, and
artificial flowers, wreaths of gauze, and silk ribbons.</p>

<p>Marcasite, spelled also marcassite, marchasite, marquesett, or
marquaset, was a mineral, the crystallized form of iron pyrites. It was
largely used in the eighteenth century for various ornamental purposes,
chiefly in the decoration of the person. It took a good polish, and when
cut in facets like a rose-diamond, formed a pretty material for shoe and
knee-buckles, earrings, rings, pins, and hair ornaments. Scarce a single
advertisement of wares of milliner or mantua maker can he found in
eighteenth century newspapers that does not contain in some form of
spelling the word marcasite, and scarce a rich gown or headdress was
seen without some ornament of marcasite.</p>

<p>Master Turner was William Turner, a&nbsp;fashionable dancing master
of Boston, who afterward resided in Salem, and married Judith, daughter
of Dr. Edward Augustus Holyoke, of Salem, who died in 1829, aged one

in the school of her youth marched through Boston streets, to the music
of the fiddle played by "Black Henry," to Concert Hall,

Turner walked at the head of the school. His advertisements may be seen
in Boston and Salem papers, thus:&mdash;</p>

he has reduced his price for teaching from Six Dollars Entrance to One
Guinea, and from Four Dollars per month to Three. Those ladies and

Storer and of Hannah Storer Green). They had no children. He was, in
1780, one of the enlisting officers for Suffolk County. In a letter of
George Green's, written July 25, 1770, we read: "Ned still lives
gentleman-like at Southwacks Court without doing any business tho'
obliged to haul in his horns;" and from another of December 5, 1770:
"Ned after having shown off as long as he you'd with his

<p>Madam Smith was evidently Anna's teacher in sewing. The duties
pertaining to a sewing school were, in those days, no light matter. From
an advertisement of one I learn that there were taught at these

<p>"All kinds of Needleworks viz: point, Brussels, Dresden Gold, Silver,
and silk Embroidery of every kind. Tambour Feather, India &amp; Darning,
Spriggings with a Variety of Open-work to each. Tapestry plain, lined,

Stitches. Diaper and Plain Darnings. French Quiltings, Knitting, Various
Sorts of marking with the Embellishments of Royal cross, Plain cross,
Queen, Irish, and Tent Stitches."</p>

<p>Miss Polly Vans was Mary Vans, daughter of Hugh and Mary Pemberton
Vans, and aunt of Caty Vans. She was born in 1733. We have some
scattered glimpses of her life. She joined the Old South
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<a name = "page107" id = "page107"> </a>
<!-- png 135 -->
in 1755. In the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, of April 9, 1770, we read, "Fan
Mounts mounted by Mary Vans at the house of Deacon Williams, in
Cornhill." We hear of her at Attleborough with Samuel Whitwell's wife
when the gates of Boston were closed, and we know she married Deacon
Jonathan Mason on Sunday evening, December 20, 1778. She was his second
wife. His first wife was Miriam Clark, and was probably the Mrs. Mason
who was present at Mrs. Whitwell's, and died June 5, 1774. Mary Vans
Mason lived till 1820, having witnessed the termination of eight of the
pastorates of the Old South Church. Well might Anna term her "a Sister
of the Old South." She was in 1817 the President of the Old South
Charity School, and is described as a "disinterested friend,
a&nbsp;judicious adviser, an affectionate counsellor, a&nbsp;mild but
faithful reprover, a&nbsp;humble, self-denying, fervent, active,
cheerful Christian." Jonathan Mason was not only a deacon, but a
prosperous merchant and citizen. He helped to found the first bank in
New England. His son was United States Senator. Two other daughters of
Hugh Vans were a Mrs. Langdon, of Wiscasset, Maine, and Mrs. John
Coburn.</p>

<p>St. Valentine's Day was one of the few English holidays observed in

sex seen in the morning was the observer's valentine. We find Madam
Pepys lying in bed for a long time one St. Valentine's morning with eyes
tightly closed, lest she see one of the painters who was gilding her new
mantelpiece, and be forced to have him for her valentine. Anna means,
doubtless, that the first person she chanced to see that morning was "an
old country plow-joger."</p>

<p>Boston was at that date pervaded by the spirit of Liberty. Sons of
Liberty held meetings every day and every night. Daughters of Liberty
held spinning and weaving bees, and gathered in bands pledging
themselves to drink no tea till the obnoxious revenue act was repealed.
Young unmarried girls joined in an association with the proud
declaration, "We, the daughters of those Patriots who have appeared for
the public interest, do now with pleasure engage with them in denying
ourselves the drinking of foreign tea." Even the children felt the
thrill of revolt and joined in patriotic demonstrations&mdash;and a year
or two later the entire graduating class at Harvard, to encourage home
manufactures, took their degrees in homespun.</p>

bringing paper and scissors when at a tea-drinking, and assiduously

was very fashionable in colonial days, and was taught under the

<p>The "biziness of making flowers" was a thriving one in Boston. We
read frequently in newspapers of the day such notices as that of Anne
Dacray, of Pudding Lane, in the <i>Boston Evening Post</i>, of 1769, who
advertises that she "makes and sells Head-flowers: Ladies may be
supplied with single buds for trimming Stomachers or sticking in the
Hair." Advertisements of teachers in the art of flower-making also are
frequent. I&nbsp;note one from the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, of October 19,
1767:&mdash;</p>

<p>This was James Lovell, the famous Boston schoolmaster, orator, and
patriot. He was born in Boston October 31, 1737. He graduated at Harvard
in 1756, then became a Latin School usher. He married Miss Helen
Sheaffe, older sister of the "two Miss Sheafs" named herein; and their
daughter married Henry Loring, of Brookline. He was a famous patriot: he
delivered the oration in 1771 commemorative of the Boston Massacre. He
was imprisoned by the British as a spy on the evidence of letters found
on General Warren's dead body after the battle of Bunker Hill. He died
in Windham, Maine, July 14, 1814. A&nbsp;full account of his life and
writings is given in Loring's <i>Hundred Boston Orators</i>.</p>

Bet Smith, a&nbsp;painful familiarity with evil unknown in any well-bred
child of to-day. Samuel Breck wrote thus of the Boston of
1771:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The large whipping-post painted red stood conspicuously and
prominently in the most public street in the town. It was placed in
State Street directly under the windows of a great writing school which
I frequented, and from them the scholars were indulged in the spectacle
of all kinds of punishment suited to harden their hearts and brutalize
their feelings. Here women were taken in a huge cage, in which they were
dragged on wheels from prison, and tied to the post with bare backs on
which thirty or forty lashes were bestowed among the screams of the
culprit and the uproar of the mob. A&nbsp;little further in the street
was to be seen the pillory with three or four fellows fastened by the
head and hands, and standing for an hour in that helpless posture,
exposed to gross and cruel jeers from the multitude, who pelted them
incessantly with rotten eggs and every repulsive kind of garbage that
could be collected."</p>

<p>There was a pillory in State Street in Boston as late as 1803, and
men stood in it for the crime of sinking a vessel at sea and defrauding
the underwriters. In 1771 the pillory was in constant use in
Newport.</p>

the night of March 5 in that year the disturbance became so great that
the troops, at that time under command of Captain Preston, fired upon
the unarmed citizens in King (now State) street, causing the death of
Crispus Attucks, a&nbsp;colored man, Samuel Gray and James Caldwell, who
died on the spot, and mortally wounding Patrick Carr and Samuel
Maverick. At the burial of these slaughtered men the greatest concourse
ever known in the colonies flocked to the grave in the Granary Burying
Ground. All traffic ceased. The stores and manufactories were closed.
The bells were tolled in all the neighboring towns.</p>

<p>Daniel Webster said, that from the moment the blood of these men
stained the pavements of Boston streets, we may date the severance of
the colony from the British empire.</p>

<p>The citizens demanded the removal of the troops, and the request was
complied with. For many years the anniversary of this day was a solemn
holiday in Boston, and religious and patriotic services were publicly
held.</p>

<p>This stove was a foot-stove,&mdash;a&nbsp;small metal box, usually of
sheet tin or iron, enclosed in a wooden frame or standing on little
legs, and with a handle or bail for comfortable carriage. In it were
placed hot coals from a glowing wood fire, and from it came a welcome
warmth to make endurable the freezing floors of the otherwise unwarmed
meeting-house. Foot-stoves were much used in the Old South. In the
records of the church, under date of January 16, 1771, may be
read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whereas, danger is apprehended from the stoves that are frequently
left in the meeting-house after the publick worship is over; Voted that
the Saxton make diligent search on the Lords Day evening and in the
evening after a Lecture, to see if any stoves are left in the house, and
that if he find any there he take them to his house; and it is expected
that the owners of such stoves make reasonable satisfaction to the

<p>We can have a very exact notion of the books imported and printed for
and read by children at that time, from the advertisements in the
papers. In the <i>Boston Gazette and Country Journal</i>, of January 20,
1772, the booksellers, Cox and Berry, have this notice:&mdash;</p>

<p>General John Winslow was but a distant kinsman of Anna's, for he was
descended from Edward Winslow. He was born May 27, 1702; died April 17,
1774. He was a soldier and jurist, but his most prominent position
(though now of painful notoriety) was as commander of that tragic
disgrace in American history, the expedition against the Acadians. It is
told in extenuation of his action that before the annihilation and
dispersion of that unfortunate community he addressed them, saying that
his duty was "very disagreeable to his natural make and temper as it
must be grievous to them," but that he must obey orders,&mdash;and of
course what he said was true.</p>

<p>The exercises attending this election of counsellors must indeed have
been an impressive sight. The Governor, attended by a troop of horse,
rode from the Province House to Cambridge, where religious services were
held. An Election Sermon was preached. Volleys and salutes were fired at
the Battery and Castle. A&nbsp;protest was made in the public press, as
on the previous year, against holding this election in Cambridge instead
of in the "Town House in Boston, the accustomed Ancient Place," and also
directly to the Governor, which was answered by him in the newspapers;
and at this election a most significant event occurred&mdash;John
Hancock declined to accept a seat among the counsellors, to which he had
been elected. The newspapers&mdash;the <i>Massachusetts Spy</i> and the
<i>Boston Gazette and Country Journal</i>&mdash;commented on his action
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr Hancocks declining a seat in the Council Board is very
satisfactory to the Friends of Liberty among his constituents. This
Gentleman has stood five years successively and as often Negativ'd.
Whatever may have been the Motive of his being approbated at last his
own Determination now shows that he had rather be a Representative of
the People since he has had so repeatedly their Election and
Confidence."</p>

<p>Boston had two election days. On Artillery Election the Ancient and
Honorable Artillery had a dress

parade on the Common. The new officers were chosen and received their
new commissions from the new Governor. No negroes were then allowed on
the Common. The other day was called "Nigger Lection," because the
blacks were permitted to throng the Common and buy gingerbread and drink
beer, as did their betters at Artillery Election.</p>

<p>Col. Thomas Marshall was a Revolutionary officer. He commanded the
Tenth Massachusetts Regiment at Valley Forge. He was Captain of the
Ancient and Honorable Artillery from 1763 to 1767, and at one time
commanded Castle Island, now Fort Independence. He was one of the
Selectmen of Boston at the time when the town was invested by troops
under Washington. He died at Weston, Mass., on November 18, 1800.</p>

<p>A night gown was not in those days a garment for wear when sleeping,
but resembled what we now call a tea-gown. The night attire was called a
rail. Both men and women wore in public loose robes which they called
night gowns. Men often wore these gowns in their offices.</p>

<p>Many Boston people agreed with Anna in her estimate of Rev. Samuel
Stillman. He was called to the First Baptist Church in 1765, and soon
became one
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
<a name = "page119" id = "page119"> </a>
<!-- png 147 -->
of Boston's most popular and sensational preachers. Crowds thronged his
obscure little church at the North End, and he took an active part in
Revolutionary politics. Many were pleased with his patriotism who did
not agree with him in doctrine. In the curious poem on Boston Ministers,
already quoted, we read:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hooper were "King" Hooper and his wife of Marblehead. He
was so called on account of his magnificent style of living. He was one
of the Harvard Class of 1763; was a refugee in 1775, and died insolvent
in 1790. The beautiful mansion which he built at Danvers, Mass., is
still standing in perfect condition, and is the home of Francis Peabody,
Esq. It is one of the finest examples of eighteenth century architecture
in New England.</p>

<p>She married Daniel Waldo May 3, 1757. The "very pretty Misses" were
their daughters; Elizabeth, born November 24, 1765, died unmarried in
Worcester, August 28, 1845; and Martha (who in this diary is called
Patty), born September 14, 1761, died November 25, 1828. She married
Levi Lincoln, Lieutenant-Governor of Massachusetts, and became the
mother of Levi Lincoln, Governor of Massachusetts, Enoch Lincoln,
Governor of Maine, and Col. John Lincoln.</p>

<p>The fashion of the roll was of much importance in those days.
A&nbsp;roll frequently weighed fourteen ounces. We can well believe such
a heavy mass made poor Anna's head "ach and itch like anything." That
same year the <i>Boston Gazette</i> had a laughable account of an
accident to a young woman on Boston streets. She was knocked down by a
runaway, and her headdress received the most serious damage. The outer
covering of hair was thrust aside, and cotton, tow, and false hair were
disgorged to the delight

of jeering boys, who kicked the various stuffings around the street.
A&nbsp;Salem hair-dresser advertised that he would "attend to the polite
construction of rolls to raise ladies heads to any pitch desired." The
Abbé Robin, traveling through Boston a few years later, found the hair
of ladies' heads "raised and supported upon rolls to an extravagant
height."</p>
